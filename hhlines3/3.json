I've been trying to erase a lot of my past ago of the sites where I'm registered on and I'm going like, I don't really want people to see this. And I'm ready. And my experience, you cannot do it that way. Ran in my experience. You can Oh, wow. But don't do it right is pos'sible, but impos'sible. Okay. Anything is pos'sible. Wow. I know. And that''s something I learned from working at Adidas also what impos'sible is also nothing. But when I was working on Cliffhanger, people were like, Hey, I don't dare you to keep working on this dangerous movie. And I said, Okay, well, how about I dare myself, Gas'ser, You did that to yourself and, you know, like I won a Tony for that movie. Yes, sir. You won the award. What does it feel like for a man to dare himself and win the Tony for that movie? I mean, it was invigorating because it is always my dream to wake up one day. And when the Tony Parker Award Wow, are That''s right. That ceremony, that''s their money is in the morning. Yeah. Yeah. And like, the weird thing about it is like you go to the awards, and it''s like you wear the tux and there''s the glitz and the glamour. And then, you know, you get inside and you think they're just gonna put you in the seats. Yeah. So you thought that Yeah, but they put a harnes's on you and hanging from the ceiling and you watch the show? No, see, and it''s like, Oh, okay. I like those early award shows Because then you still have your whole day once it''s over, you know, like you can actually do your own stuff. Yeah, well, you know, the the slogans of the award show is come early so you can hang out later. Well, we were laughing. Do were like, when you're up there, you're like, OK, alright. Wrote this and get it up. You have to give a writer''s name was Cliff, and I was like, Wow, this is just like, is this coincidence? Is this you know? Yeah, dog, that was in green It I was seven, but it was just like, OK, Cliff Bemis was the head writer of the show within the show on the grinder. Yeah. Yeah, I know how many of these words is you're talking. What? Which percentage, The words do you know? Yeah, which under you just kind of gas'sing. And which ones are you like? Fully knowing what they mean, right? Well, let let it we're gonna go with Do you want to go with percentages or like, an actual count? Because the last sentence I said I knew three words. Okay. Oh, wow. And it was a long sentence. It was a run on action, so Yeah, so that''s gotta be Wow, you're functioning. Such a high level. Just cold gues'sing What sounds you should make with your mouth at almost every turn. Yeah. So it''s like that I'm good at that. I'm also good at cup stacking. Those are the two things that, like, I've That''s Big Man has picked up. Yeah, I just picked that up. That''s the future of entertainment. Really? Because weve kind of tapped into almost every other avenue. Obviously, people arent going to be watching TV. You're going Teoh Peter anymore. But cops stacking cups down, and it''s getting democratized to the point where it used to be like the just the ivory Tower cup stackers. But now you see lots of people, just like kids were doing there was such a barrier to entry before. You are really People were only allowed to have two or three cups, right? And now it''s like where I think my last count. I saw seven Wow. And I was like, OK, rebuilding the pyramid. Yeah. And how many of those air you able to actually stack me? Seven. Yeah, for okay. The sad thing is that I don't know how to stack From. So it actually is just two cups with two cups under them. Okay, I can picture this. Yeah, that''s pretty strong. So when you see that you're, like, others to couple in table and then I'm to be like nights, actually is like a sculpture, so Okay, we are going to take a break now. Um, is there anything you want a plug before we go to the break? Um, yeah, I, uh, again, a lot of people? No, that I work at g E s o actually, weirdly wanna plug surge protectors.

And at the very last last minute. I was kind of brought in to replace the lead actor, and it was supposed to be my big break and then it kind of publicly went away. And a lot of people, you know, you can't really find that show. It doesn't exist. Comedy Central doesn't really allow it to be out in the world, and there's always been many rumors about the backstage stuff, and we kind of went all in for the first time and spoke publicly about a lot of my demons addictions. And did I come up at all? Um, not on the show, but I mean, I don't want to fan any flames. But as soon as we were done taping, he's did stand up and he took his headphones off and he threw them down and he was like, Sean could never do that. Shawn could never do that. He throws him down like a touchdown spike, like he''s happy with what he did or like just a mad throw. It was I would I would say The phrase that comes into my mind is more like animal adrenaline. I don't think he meant to throw them. I think he was. He was in a He was acting on impulse. OK, right. OK, so that''s just pure energy coming out of him. And he said, I could never do that. No, he said You He said Sean could never do. Sean could. Yes. He didn't say I do that. No, he''s Hayes said, Sean never. Yes, yes. Is Sean speaking? Yes. And I'm saying what you're saying. Hey said you're Chris us? Yes. And he said Sean could never do. Yes. Yeah, we're on the same page. Mm. How does that make me feel? So that''s the only time I came up. And then what did you say? You probably defended me and said, I think he could. I think that when I kept quiet, I mean, he was really It was like, really like, um, like, you know, like there was a violence to it. There was a violence and an emotion to, and I just tried to say that I brought you a before and asked where you were actually known you much longer. Well, I was going to say, Isn't it strange to do an episode of haze when meanwhile, weve known each other longer? Probably better. Oh, you and there was a stretch of life where you and I were very, very, very close. Yeah, and did he Was he able to deal with that? Uh, I brought it. I said I asked where you were. I said that You and I Really, I mean, this is not in any way exaggerated. You and I, for many years were very, very tight on, and I asked. I said I was really looking forward to the chance to catch up with Sean. I feel like we lost touch a little bit. I've always regretted that. And, uh, he said, Really, this was before the mikes run. And then he said you had something else to dio. I asked what, and he said, I'd rather not tell you. I have a feeling it could make you feel bad if you knew that Sean opted to do that thing over what? Over this. And then did he do any kind of hand gesture's to indicate what it was I was doing? Uh, he he did a number of hand gesture's, but I have to say I'm not neces'sarily trained in perceiving what his hand gesture's mean. But he was. It''s funny that you say that? Cause he was gesturing his hands wildly as he was going. He was doing one of these. A little bit of this. A little. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sort of sticking his hands around. Yeah, he''s Now wrong. Anyway, did you guys talk about politics at all or anything? No, mostly It was about about the show. Yeah, I told him a lot because, you know, he had seen a lot and he had been there for a lot. And many, many rumors about my behavior and Big Lake. So I told him about some of the addictions. I fell into a lot of the sex for money. Different, you know, things I was inhaling, injecting back in those days, a lot of demons. I told him a lot about how my character overtook my personality. And this Josh Franklin character kind of came to dominate my mind and live inside my brain in a way where Josh Franklin controlled my thoughts in my action. Ah, yes. Not unlike the Joker. Yeah, Yeah. Very similar. Yeah. Uh, so Okay. Interesting. You really did not listen to even a minute. I just I just couldn't I have to say for people who heard that one tuning back into the same podcast's just to hear you recap the bullet point Recap of recap I have a prior recent episode of the same. You don't think that''s gonna be a real thrill? I would have to imagine. A lot of people are remembering the more fully fleshed out version's of the jokes were Now just describing in simple terms. So if I so OK, so if I clear on what you're saying, if I'm clear on what you're saying, I don't think there''s a single laugh for them to be had so far in this episode because it''s really just a dry retailing oven episode.

You think that that the carnival mirror is how clowns looked away? So carnival mirror is a little different as well. Circus mirror and a carnival mirror. Not neces'sarily the same thing, but a funhouse mirror is not either of those. No, no, no. Okay, wait a second. Let me let then if a clown put on makeup in a normal mirror, would he not look clownish, would it just looked like very nice makeup. You're saying if he wasn't using a funhouse or carnival mirror? I honestly think all makeup is for clowns, and I prefer natural natural women. Well, I think I actually think that all mirrors in any house is a fun house mirror. If I'm there, did you read?

How would you, uh how would you deal with what we do have to tactics when we just get rid of it completely. All the sand. Okay, but how are we doing that? Because I know I saw you out there with a vacuum about a week ago. It didn't seem like you're making a ton of Prague, right? And you werent really trying that hard From and you're listening to music while you dio is dancing. Yeah, well, I'm going to get to vacuum. Just vacuum. It honestly reminded me of that dirt devil commercial where they updated the Fred Astaire dancing with the coach. And they had him vacuuming on the ceilings and stuff. Yeah, so that''s one that I'm going to do is the vacuum, or we get it wet. So it''s harder to get in your pores. So all of the sand is like my it''s so it''s not gonna be flying around that smart. Okay, well, waters over there. Yeah, and the sand is you know, they're gonna get I'm gonna use the vacuum hose and expect will be helpful, because we do. I know we don't want any sand there.

A lot of them have, like a crocodile''s mouth coming out of a moat, right? No. Then, like, I think that''s illegal. Please, As far as this is concerned. We wanted to be able to be fun.

Yeah. Under under close as close is not It''s not enough. You know what? If you're doing that, that''s the wrong kind of attention. Yeah, if that''s how you're getting famous for. I'm sorry. Uh, somebody call, You know, someone, the police or something. So can we start? Can we start on my Book? Yeah, absolutely. It''s called Hayes. I wish I was your lover. Ah, Science like that. Signed the people of Earth. So which is a show? It is not about the show about the show people over. Okay. Yeah, but so the title is a letter from the people of Earth to you? Yes. And they wish Okay, in the form of you know that. You know, this parody of a song they're going Hey, I wish I was your lover. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So it''s a parody of that? Yes. Does it go any further than the title? That can see? Yeah. Not really. Okay, there might be some more song parodies inside, but that doesn't really come up again. Okay. Uh, again, again, I think you have to go a step further to call it a parody. Okay, well, it''s just funny on in this argument before, but it is for actually cracking me up, just hearing them even say it also like Come on, it''s funny. And it sounds like the name of the song, but it''s a little different. One word is different. And so that is actually exactly what a song parody is. Oh, again, there''s room for note to give you some examples. There was a song called beat it. Yeah, And then the song became called Eat It. No, I know that, but that was officially a song parody. But I'm gonna just stop you there. Because what? That was weird out. Okay? What he also did was he did the whole song. I need it. You know how it sounds like be. No way. Yeah, I know he did. He rewrote the whole thing and re recorded the whole thing and made it about about how he wants to eat it. Oh, I want you to eat it. Yeah. Hey, you should eat it like here''s food. And so we talked about a bunch of foods and why you should eat it. So, like having banana have a whole bunch? It doesn't matter what you had for lunch. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah. That''s exactly right. He did the whole thing. And then, if that''s what makes it a parody, Okay, Little try hard at that point. I don't know, man. Well, well, well. What about this example? Cause I know he didn't do it for this. He did. Ah, he parody Love Obama. And he said lasagna. Okay. Like that was the whole parody. Yeah. Yeah, But I think also he did the whole song. He''s going la la la la lasagna Are all The saw eggs? Kind of about this about eating food? Does this is this have to be his? So does hazes in order to be a parody. Doesn't have happy about food Has to be about food because I have one about food for mine, which is good. Obviously, when life gives you climates make Clement aid and then Clement date it says, like like Beyonce''s Clemen Aid. And then so that''s about food, you know? Where does it say that? Uh, where does it say? Like Piat says you when you open it up, you know, the greeting cards that you hope it up, they talk to you. Yeah, and so what, you open the first major gets like Beyonce''s club in A you know, And and I was also hoping to use a lot of her because people really liked lemonade. Yeah, because it was use a lot of rest. Seems I'd like to use a lot of that please, because that seems like it was over a lot better than some of what I've been doing. Okay, One her stuff.

It''s just me and another, like, sort of clever white guy, like, kind of like cackling at each other, like half shots at things that are more popular than we are.

No. You know those signs that they put in like a warehouse that will say this workplace has blank number of days without an axe. Okay, Yes. Say, like, 45 then cros's out and say 00 What about like, this relationship has blank number of days without an argument.

Let me think. There's really only one thing that''s aunt right, which is I love HH, although you're even at wrong about that. Because if you love a change, you do really care about Shawn''s take on film because the whole fucking show is just my fucking take on Hayes''s tank on fucking media and television and film and Hollywood and actors and people in the entertainment industry and the way they behave, and that is what HH is. So basically, you either do love HH or you don't really care about Shawn''s take on film. And maybe you don't care about my take on film because you just wanted to put out your take on film and have your little moment where you get to feel like Sean Hollywood. Hamburg could get to tell everybody what he thinks about the different things easy, and you're gonna now be this smart guy. It actually know what''s really going on in Midnight special, and that you actually have to admit in your review that everyone agrees the film lose's your words a little when it gives away some of the early mystici'sm. Well, the whole fucking first half of the movie is just handed on you being curious about the early Mrs um and the color and all that, and it es'sentially is just the audience, sort of putting together the puzzle pieces of trying to figure out exactly what''s going on. And my experience was as soon as I had gotten the edges of the puzzle in place. I found out that the entire center of the puzzle was just one big piece that got dropped in in a moment. But I still had to sit there and look at the finish puzzle for another hour and 20 minutes. So my experience at the film was not that enjoyable, but you liked it. So I gues's you are the person who does have a take on film we all need to Hear. And, ah, is it true? I gues's that comedians don't make good critics. Is that a good characterization to make that entire profes'sion would make good critics? Ah, profes'sion, who basically on Lee thinks about media and people and structuring stories and jokes and trying to come up with ways to surprise comedy is just surprised weve got over that, which is something that maybe a lot of films want to try to do, too, is give you information and entertaining and surprising way. And isn't that what comedians want to dio? And I also wonder, since you know so much what jobs are good critics, what exactly is your job that makes you such a good critic? I mean, I know that you're on Reddit writing a comment. So you must be what? The fuckin a o scott from the fuckin New York times? Are you just some fucking Schumacher who did it? Like what I said about a movie? Because you liked it. Maybe you feel done that you didn't get it, that they screwed up the movie. And by the way, if I don't like the bug in parts of imitation game where it''s a bunch of little kids acting and I did like the other parts of it and I wanted to stop going back to that, that doesn't mean that I don't understand the concept to characterization. It means I didn't enjoy watching that part of the film. And I'm allowed to say that without someone taking the entire profes'sion, which, by the way, I'm not really comedian. I'm actually fucking screenwriter, and that''s what I get paid to do more than I don't do Fuck it. Stand up jokes. Okay. So, yeah, I think I thought a lot about stories and I could put it up on the screen for people to enjoy. So that''s just that''s this aside. No, but what is it that you do again? I can't remember. So anyway, it''s a net pick to you different 40 minutes into the film. I don't like the movie anymore. I don't know that doesn't feel that nit picky to me. There were plenty of plot twist's for you. Let me ask you something. Son of a mama. Was there any point where you didn't think the kid was going to get to the fucking drop zone at the moment that he needed to be there? No. You knew he was gonna get there. Did you not know what was gonna happen after he said, Like, the aliens live in the world, but they're just in a layer that we can't see.

One night of no kidding and so breaking news, Casper is a great Mattres'ses. I have heard that before, and I heard in my sleep I was sleeping. How do we get this scoop? Yeah, No, it's the oldest story. It''s It''s literally the greatest story ever told all this tale. It''s alleged that we all know the models of the Casper-Mattres'ses The Wave, The es'sential ah, and the original Casper are basically The three archetypes that you see over and over again in storytelling. Joseph Gamble talked about thes Mattres'ses, But one thing that we didn't neces'sarily discu'ss before because we're so focused on the Amazing Night''s sleep you can get, is that these are really good Mattres'ses, Teoh. A good firm mas'sage on. And just for people to really dig in and hit all the points so you can sleep on it at night on your back. But what about during the day when the sun comes up, you're looking at this thing you like. What is this like? I just throw it away. No, you keep it. And they have technology. Now, uh, that you can now cut a hole in the mattres's for your face and stick your face through and still be able to breathe and see the shoes of the person who''s standing above you and is really digging in and getting all the points and giving a firm Mas'son s. So instead of getting up and throwing it away, you can stay on it all day. Getting a mas'sage, whether it''s your scaling, is your Rahm Boyd''s your cue allergy, Aurelio. So as that means a little extra attention, just call me a word. Oh, yes, sorr sorr sartorius. And that''s The Taylor muscle which actually articulates From one of your hip points all the way down acros's on the opposite side of the knee. And so if you picture a tailor, sort of with their one leg cros'sed over their knee up in the air so that they can do the stitching on the surface. They're activating that muscle and take what someone could do on a Casper mattres's is just go all the way down and get on the inside and touch it.

Yes. Um, that's kind of been the traditional way that the podcast industrie's operated is you either make money off doing a live show, or if you want a merchandiser show and have shirts, then you don't have any live shows. And so here we run into this problem, which is you go to a show and you have no share or you put on your shirt and you sit down and wear it anywhere. Yes. And no one sees it. Yes. So what weve decided to do. Hayes and I are known for disrupting $1,000,000,000 tech industrie's. And yet again, uh, we're going to just shatter the norms and say, We have shirts. Yes. And you can wear them to our show. And our show is basically a shirt show. Yeah, where everyone who wears our shirt to the show and buys a ticket will get into the show. Exactly. It''s a special promotion that we're doing Where if you wear the shirt, obviously there''s limited. I mean, you know, we have to put a cap on it. Sure, they're only enough people as there is tickets can have a fis'sure in the show, but both can be done by you if you're in time. So we are announcing the shirt showdown, which is you go to pot swag dot com and you by our new shirt that says Nice and smart and cool and funny and being nice. And it''s in the style of those like shirts that nobody copyrighted it. So everyone that''s just like it was just completing Off Molly Deluded. Yeah, uh, and then it says The Boys on it as well, and it''s on pots white dot com, and so is part of the shirt showdown. You buy the shirt you go to wear. Where do they buy a ticket? Chef Kevin Ah Dynasty-Typewriter. If you Google at and then Hollywood Handbook The tickets air there, it''s only two quick Google searches away on. So that''s on Friday, April 13th. It''s in Los Angeles, which is where Ah, a lot of our fans live and this says, and you can travel there, join us for an exclusive live V I P backstage pas's in the 10 potential towns politics. Did you write this? Now? Why does it say that they get a backstage pas's. I think their life show they accidentally put your show description in this life description, which is like not a good cros'sover, because nobody is going Vietcombank Stage Pas's for a live show is an unfortunate terminology, because people will think that. What if I had just read that and not realize how stupid it was his into Tinseltown''s politics? But really, what it sounds like is that they're going to get to it. Come in the dres'sing room or whatever, and either snack. Nobody is going to talk to us at all anywhere but as part of the shirt showdown. You buy the shirt, and if you show up to the show with shirt and a ticket, you will be allowed a seat at the show, and the showdown aspect is that it''s a contest. So it''s all happening. Friday, April 13th at 8 p.m. By the shirt Before then, obviously, and the ticket and then our promise to you come to the show and it''s a contest.
