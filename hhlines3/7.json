There's great value with the unlimited download model. Unlimited downloads to the library of 100,000 plus HD video clips after effects templates and motion backgrounds. 250,000 graphics. On average, subscribers pay less than a dollar per download over the course of a year. That's almost nothing. And, ah, in terms of whether you feel like I'm judging you with those examples. Ah, I like that vertical horizon song, too, so I would never judge someone for that. There's premium content, the same content you would find on more expensive stock sites. But we have it here for less great variety of time lapse aerials, US international locations, slow motion nature shots if you know what I mean and more continuously.

We really respect you guys. Respect what you're doing on. So heres how to do your own audiobooks. If you wanna go the anarchist route, you just go to the library. You look just very casual. You just sort of go right up to the water found, maybe drink a lot of water. People say like, Oh, he's just here. Toe, get a drink on. Then you take some gum and use the gum toe stick the water fountain button down. So it z whats pressed down and the water keeps flowing and that way theyll hear the water found and think you're still taking a drink. But while it's running, you go over to the book section of the library and you find the book you like. If the book isnt there, you go to a different library. You start. You know, you do the waterfront thing again there, Um, so you get the book, you flip through the book, you get a sense of some of the characters voices, cause you're gonna be reading this out loud. So just flip through the book enough to know, like, whos a girl and stuff on. Then what you do is you take out your phone and you open a voice memo you hit record on, and that this is the important part is you hold the phone up to your ear like you are having a phone conversation and you read the book into the phone on. If somebody tells, you know, phone to the library, then just go to the bathroom and do it. They're facing a urinal because they're not allowed. Toc stop you from using your phone at a urinal. And if you're a girl that you can still you're you're allowed to use that bathroom as well. It's against the law for them to tell you that you can't, um, some reasons to use audible if you like to go that route instead. Uh, they include, like I said, 180,000 audio programs. Free APS for iPhones, iPad, Android Windows phone. You can listen on pretty much any device you own your books. There's whisper Sync, let You switch.

I'm here with Sean Clement. What up? What up? We are sort of gentleman about town in Hollywood. Where the movies industry is and something we like to do is to teach other people how to become famous in Hollywood. And one of the biggest mistakes that people make when they're trying to be Hollywood guys is in the when they're pitching movies. And when you have the opportunity to pitch a movie to a haze or a Sean or to ah Spielberg or a Vince Von or to an own will Sonora Luke Wilson or an Andrew Wilson, you don't want to squander that opportune. You want to make the most of it. So we do a segment on the show that people love called pitch perfectly. I can't tell you how many times early in my pitching crew when I kind of just moved out here. I don't think I didn't unpack my clothes where I would pitch a movie and the guys would be like, Great, whats lets do it? Lets do the movie and I would be driving home And that's when I'd have, like, the, like, the forehead slap mother, lightning bug. My men do a big face palm, uh, and be like, Why didn't I pinch myself into the friggin movie? Yes, and I remember when I had first moved out here and I don't even think I'd put on shoes yet. I think I was still in, like, slipper socks, and I was pitching, you know, 10 15 movies a day and they were getting made. And then I would be on my moped head, just sort of cruising back towards my house. And I would have that moment that we all think of the sort of moment where you just jam your thumb in your eye and you go like you stupid, and you and you are so mad.

Yeah, but I mean just an example of a time thes air friends of ours who made this mistake when the Nat Faxon and Jim Rash were pitching the descendants. Good friends, you were sort of community freaks. Six seasons of movie and the movie and a theme park. We love all the little inside stuff, the Internet that those guys were pitching that movie and the movie is fine, the fine movie. But, um, they pitch it sort of like George Clooney is an attorney, and he's the sole trustee of kind of his his familys trust. And he's deciding whether or not to sell the land or to keep to make a lot bigger. And at the same time, his his wife is in a boat accident and she's in a coma, smashed a boat with her hat, and he finds out that at the same time she has been unfaithful to him with the Matthew Lower. And so he and Shelling Woodley and his other daughter, Goto, find math to get answers about his wifes infidelity. Me, Beau Bridges Yeah, if we're pitching that movie, we go. So George Clooneys an attorney in Hawaii, right and we go. But you never see him. Yeah, you never see him That's in the background. Meanwhile, yeah. Meanwhile, the two lesser friggin laying out of the beach like chilling with, like, sipping out of, ah, half a coconut, snapping thongs right straight up, shark and girls splashing around Thea other coconuts Kind of hanging off our dame dogs is where Yeah, do it. Craigs of the beach breaks that stuff Speech pranks, sand in the in the drink, sand in the food, all the famous beach pranks Cranking up a CDO and being looked way than getting a rambling whoa And yeah, like as soon as it looks like you're gonna wipe out you, like, do a flip And that's something you like, right side up and you're fine and you splash the nerd and the nerves like mangling, sees and Shaleum. Woodley is still there, and she's like our girlfriend. Then she's, like, really down to earth and chill. But like she also knows how to be sort of a freaks of a to the same time. There is a more traditionally hot girl that wants us, and we're boning her and the whole time going like But isnt our conversations with saline even better? And can we have it all? And that's whats so chill about. Saline is a girlfriend that, like she understands that, like, you know, like for us to be able to experiment and stuff, it actually makes our bomb little bit stronger. Yeah, her because we can appreciate. Like when I was boning that traditionally hot girl, we had literally nothing to talk about. Yes, I think that's did She leans benefit, right? And exactly. And that's exactly right and how you can, like, do the boning and not have to worry about it so much anymore. You just like and we're not all boned out after that one. Narrow. We still have something for shame Lean, and I think that's a really important man. Sometimes it gives you something to think about when you're boning like you're chilled down to Earth girlfriend, like some other good bone that you like, had recently, yes, and so there's sort of that message. And then, maybe at the end, Clooney pops up over the credits like there's, like a bonus seen with him. I guess wed be there, too, but maybe it's us with Clooney. And so you know it's still the descendants like you still do have the Clooney aspect. Oh, sure, but doesn't this movie sound more marketable? More fun, more funny, more cool and is an opportunity for you. The pit I mean, you know that that is a big part of it. It's an opportunity for you to get your brand out there in a way that you can't just buy, like writing a bunch of words for other people to say. Like if you're you're the one pitching the movie you control whats in the movie you might like. You might as well put yourself in there. Yeah, you wouldn't go like to pitch a big company or something toe like a bank bank guy and be like, heres this, like, really great company. Have a really awesome idea I want to do for, like, friggin the Starbucks guy to do instead. Why would you do that? It's the opposite of what you would want to dio You don't see people on shark tank uh, going in and going like, oh, I've got a new way for moms. Teoh change like sheets that they, you know, there could pissed on or whatever and then going like and fucking give all the money. Teoh fucking You know, the digger, Dunkin Donuts guy or whatever Tinkertoys. You know, Dude, when the money gets made and make sure he's famous afterwards, it's like, why it makes no sense.

Actually, that's a That's a joke. And I think that crack that, like, an egg is a joke. Ah, fuck, yeah, We say it. Ah, probably once or twice a page in the script just because it is so funny to think about an egg cracking, but we mean cracking it, like figuring it out. So you guys are sending me notes for Volleyball: A Real Underdog Story. And I'm taking the notes and taking my past, but you're taking a separate past together. You guys just hanging out. You know what it was is we just started hanging a little more. Um, uh, we ran into each other at this sort of little ah soir, Eh? That was taking place on Scotsmans bus. I You had a party on the bus.

And that And I love that message that Chuck Berry like, probably couldn't have figured it out himself because he just didn't have the sort of faculty to do so. But Nike cousin was able to record a white man playing it, and that is how we got all this great music we Love. There's a lot of conversations that we have about the movie, then Junk. Berry was a dumb idiot, and it's Guzman has brought up this point that maybe sort of the way we celebrate diversity is kind of false. And that probably is man. A lot of the inventions are only coming from one people. You know, You know, I I just want to say, Sean, I'm a little worried about, like, some because I'm just hearing discussed.

Um, I don't know if that's true, Sean. I don't feel that way. I mean, I hear what I'm trying to say is that I've woken up a little bit, too. Who discussed man really is a person.

The sense and the memories smell is the sense most closely related to memory Cents S E N S C, not S C, E and ts, which is what he was saying before when he said the sense of his childhood.

When his mom was doing the load of laundry and the smell he would inhale so deeply it and how he desired to be closer to it. Somehow it was a smell that was at the same time thrilling and frustrating. How could he have mawr of it?

I mean, it's inspired by our Love for back to the future. Remember, you get your damn dirty hands offer, you know? Yeah, So it's kind of like that. He's time traveling through his nose because the smell makes him remember being a child and curling up. No, I didn't like a team from the dryer was I didn't know they were going to be seeing that.
