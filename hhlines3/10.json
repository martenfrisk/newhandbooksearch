And I am here to talk about Squarespace. Turn your idea your great idea into a great reality with squares. Squarespace. Ah, well, weve talked about some is'sues around Squarespace in the past. Great product, Like the function, it's easy to use, uh, easier launch any of your pas'sion projects. A pas'sion project that Sean Did launch recently after some of his domains that he put up there had been seized by different government departments. He had this idea. Weve been over this before, but to put, like, basically a blank site up, uh, that would give people the functionality to write or draw design's and mes'sages of peace to each other. And it was called the peaceful post. Ah, and it was just a place where people could on the Internet, could relax and be creative and also read other people''s mes'sages for inspiration. Ah, and the the only person who used it turned out to be someone who just wrote the do do man on it. Ah and Sean ah went ballistic and he like, I tried to find out who it was that wrote the duty man. He used some kind of like I p tracing technology, I actually think was part of the peaceful post that, like, whatever you Did on it, it would reveal your location somehow not just like in that moment, but ongoing. I didn't really think that was pos'sible, but, uh, So Sean figured out it was the backpack kid. He tried to arrest the backpack kid, but the backpack kid was flos'sing too hard and too expertly for Sean to get the handcuffs on him. S Oh, Sean has decided to destroy the backpack kid by becoming him. Ah, he is worrying to flog us really well and really fast. There has been an is'sue so far that, like when he''s swinging his arms in the back, he has ended up punching and chopping his but a lot to the point of, ah, hospitalization multiple times from just like chopping it too hard and too fast. But he really is getting good. And eventually he is going to build a site that is going to just have the video of him basically being the backpack. It better than the backpack kid ever was. He''s working on getting a backpack as well right now. He has kind of like a soft place mat that he has, like folded to create kind of a sack and stapled it to the back of his shirt. That is creating a pretty good backpack illusion.

Ah, I just Ah, I am actually adding new elements to the pillow. I thought it could be really interesting to have this mouse of a mouse on it. That's sleeping. And to have so so the mouse is dreaming of a piece of cheese. Ah, and then I was a come. What would the cheese dream about? And so the cheese, you know, there''s like a little dreaming bubble from the cheese, and the cheese is dreaming about some cut up apples. That would be that it wants to be, like combined with ah, and then the cut up apples are dreaming about Steve Jobs because of Apple computer. Ah, Steve Jobs is dreaming about computer, and so, like it just it kind of continues in this chain all the way around the pillow. Everyone, everything is dreaming about something else, which is true. Ah, and then it loops back around like I accidentally ran out of space. And so I have a baseball bat that is dreaming about the mouse because that''s just like when it looped around. There wasn't enough room to put another thing in between. So I decided, I gues's, figure out a story for why that would be happening. Uh, guys, the easie'st way to ease back into a post summer routine simplified the morning and evenings with an electric toothbrush from Quip times. Sonic vibrations offering effective clean. That''s gentle on your sensitive gums in just two minutes, twice a day. So I gues's this is that''s, like, one way to do it, for sure. Uh, for me, this is the time of year, end of September, like after I have gone back to school for a couple weeks. This is when I will do all my tooth brushing for the entire year. I I will just carve out a week. I will not go to school. Ah, and just get it all done. So two minutes a day, twice a day. Ah, that''s Ah, four minutes a day, times three and 65. So I will basically just brush my teeth for over 1000 minutes. Ah, and that saves me. I feel like from having to, like, go like, Oh, I'm doing something else. Oh, no, I got to go brush my teeth. It''s like actually making the time for this very important thing. Ah, but just like doing it all at once. And I always rent a place I would like go up the coast and I want to place and I brush my teeth for over 1000 minutes. Ah, and the moat to use cover works as a stand and mounts to Miers putting brushing front and center in your bathroom. So obviously, if you do it the way I do it, you do not need to be reminded throughout the year with the stand or whatever, You can basically put it away until next year. Better yet, the lightweight compact design means you can bring it along with you on those last summer weekend getaways, so that is useful to May and brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just $5 making it easy to stay committed to your oral health. I don't need them. I love Quip. I love the toothpaste. I I love that. It tells me when I'm done brushing good products, and that''s why I love Quip and why it''s perfect for getting back into a routine Quip starts in just $25. If you go to get Quip dot com slash The Boys right now, you can get your first refill pack for free. That''s your first refill pack for free at g et qu dot com slash The Boys Way.

I don't even know what it's called the way it is. It''s a show. It''s kind of like cops like. But basically they catch restaurant's dumping grease down storm drains, and so it.

I think it''s called saying like it doesn't have as good a title honestly, which is why it''s not memorable.

Just choose from a variety of step by step chef designed recipe options, all with insanely delicious flavors. Then get rid of your grocery list and let Blue Apron do the meal prep for you. Whether you're looking for a quick and easy mitt, meals are full culinary cooking experience. Blue Apron has you covered? Um still me. Just me. I am very happy with how this is going. How I'm doing. I do think I'm doing a good job. Um, you will notice doing this ad Normally, Chef Kevin would sort of appear ah, and sort riff off of his takes on the theme menu for this month for her Blue Apron or some of the foods that they're doing this month. Um, and you may be noticing that we don't have any foods mentioned in the ad this week. Blue Apron is, of course, still doing foods. Um, but one reason we're skipping them this week is there was, ah, little mis'step with Kevin''s plan for the foods that that he wanted to do this week. He wanted to dio scary Halloween Blue Apron Ah, and of course, Kevin''s sort of signature food is spaghetti, and he was going to prepare the spaghetti in a way that it was the witches hair. And he, of course, when you're sending the Blue Apron food, they don't said they send ingredients, they don't send him all cooked already. Of course, that''s a fun. You do it yourself, and I love doing it. But the spaghetti was dried, and it came with a recipe of that he Did called Scary Soup. But that was already hot, and there was an is'sue in the delivery proces's where there was a guy driving a truck, and he''s driving the scary soup and the witches hair. The dried spaghetti and some of the scary soup, which was very high, Did spill. And it Did, uh, boil the spaghetti, which caused it to very rapidly increase in size. And the cook spaghetti busted through the wall of the truck into the cab where the driver was, and the driver Did drowned in spaghetti. Although that''s allegedly what happened, it is unclear if he was going to drown already and if it didn't have anything to do with the spaghetti. So that is sort of the legal avenue that Kevin is exploring now, although he is currently in jail. So that''s why there''s no blue. It does. That is, just to explain why there''s no specific Blue Apron foods. You can check out this week''s menu and get your 1st 3 meals free at Blue Apron dot com slash handbook.
