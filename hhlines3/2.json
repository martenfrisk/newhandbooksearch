So it may be it would be helpful of you. Say what has been going on. So Okay, so look, support comes from Squarespace, you know, and they support. Okay, they support the podcast, but they don't neces'sarily support all of our ventures. Right? Because if you heard my last ad and apparently Squarespace did, I was using the Squarespace technology in order to build a new website that would be sort of like a plug in on ESPN dot com, which is me and he's site. Every sports plus news, the spinning wheel and captains will. It's a captain''s wheel that you click on, and then you're the captain and you take over and you can build a site, and it''s it has beautiful templates created by world clas's designer's. It''s totally easy to turn your idea new new and unique website. You can focus your work blogger published content, even sell product or service of all kinds of just a few clicks, customized everything From look and feel to settings and products. And it''s all optimized for mobile. Right out of the box is actually only true of Squarespace. That was not gonna be true of mine. You were never gonna do that. I just didn't know do that. But I was doing the rest on Sean Space, which was the captain''s wheel. And so Squarespace heard our last ad. Yes, and they have been going in at night. Whenever I go to sleep every night, every single night and they take apart Sean space, they destroy it. Then they leave the pieces on the ground. And, yes, so they know where to be thrown out. Yeah, I have to start over crafting new pieces. And so when I wake up, I rebuild it and I watch it. I stay and watch all day, and then when I fall asleep, if I owned a taking a micro nap or whatever they do, come in when I'm asleep. Like Freddy Krueger. And they destroy Yes, they ruin the site. So it''s a good busine'ss model for them, you know? Ah, you Squarespace is analytics to help you grow in real time on your side. And there is nothing to install, patch or upgrade ever. That''s true of Squarespace. That was not gonna be true, Sean Space. Ah, there would be stuff to install, patch and upgrade. Always. But so Squarespace is a little ahead of me on that, which is like then why you have to go destroy my just let you do it. If it''s that as good, that should be good for about Yeah, but they know because they know I'm breathing down their net. Ah, dreams. Just a great idea that doesn't have a website yet. And that''s and he's talk about one of your dreams that you've had. Well, okay, so here''s what I think we can do for the end with the Boys. Yeah, it''s like, Yeah, I had a dream. Or maybe Kevin, you should do it. Do it, Kevin, Because well, like, acted out. Yeah, and you're, like, about to check out. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You had a dream that you're checking out at the counter for your website. Yes. So I had this dream last night that you know, is about to check out your accurate now. But you were at Squarespace dot com for a free trial and don't, like, say it like like you're describing what''s happening, actually, take me into the dream. Yeah, and then when you're ready to launch is when we're talking about OK, so you close your eyes and bad you open your eyes and your at this like what looks like a grocery store. But it actually says Squarespace dot com. Yeah, that''s fun. A grocery store in on the shelves is like website. It''s like different website's. Mia. And you grab your website from one of the shelves, you walk over to the cashier and you say hi, I'm ready to check out. I'm ready to launch reddish Watches. Yeah. Yeah. And they go, OK, and then they're like, Oh, hang on. Let me charge you full price. Yeah, thatll be like a 1,000,000 bucks. Really? Box would like to charge you full price.

Ah, One thing we do remember is that it was very, very tense trying to get to the front of the line for, like a checkpoint and that they did that about three times in the last half hour of the movie. Um, and we have the part of our mis'sion coming up where we have to do checkpoints, and we're very stres'sed about it because I don't know how we're gonna get through three of them. I don't remember how they got through it. I just remember there was sort of like, a ticking clock like, Oh, no. What about the thing when we get to the checkpoint? Yeah, that happened and then immediately happened again and then immediately happened again in that movie. And we're afraid that that might happen, tow us and then happened to us again and then happened again. And so we're feeling very scared. Um, we have tried to get in touch with some of the people who did that movie, Uh, but really all of them while weve gotten back, is they are still saying, Argo, fuck yourself. That's very funny to them. You have is funny to me too. And I have been laughing, but I've also been trying to tell them Hey, we really need help. We're trying to do this super Argo mis'sion in this country where they have a lot of sand that can say name a country. But it''s one of the mean ones, and they were trying to do something special and be heroes. And you guys are making it hard, because when we ask you a question, you just go, Argo, fuck yourself and we crack up just as we did when we watched that screener two years ago, maybe three years ago. Um And, uh so that is fun. And we could all use some levity, but it also is not great just because what we're dealing with is we might get stopped at a checkpoint, maybe die. And my only hope is that there''s one guy who seems really difficulty and, like not on board with the plan and that hell step up and be a hero. Like what I think happened at the end of the argo. The original, Not the original Argo, the Argo, where they were the rial Argo where they were pretending to make a movie called Argo. That was a fake movie that, I gues's at one point, was a real movie. And it was based on a true story. So now we're doing a fake version of that real movie where they were pretend to make a real movie in a fake way. So anyway, that''s all the news from the Super Argo front.

Because to me, that''s not really showbiz. Isn't Mr No, it''s not. It''s it''s it''s artsy bullshit. Yeah, and I'll tear down those all to comics. It''s fake. Pretentious bullshit.

It's exciting, Like there's a lot of stakes to the scene. Okay, just from an academic screenwriting perspective, it's all there. Okay, But personally, for me, it's hard to read this stuff well. And I think we hear a lot about how there's sort of a double standard with nudity and film and that women get exploited and you don't really get to see Big juicy man mead. Ah, blasting all over.

See, this is well, you saw Well, that's Yeah, Well, yeah, I think it's a stretch to say that this is a gender issue. You know that? That that this was trying to confront some sort of, well, female gender? I would I would at least hope that you copped to the fact that this is directed at me and that this is almost on intimidation measure to get me toe sign over the rights to the slide. Just because we need E in the script is humiliated, gets jerked off on and then murdered because he won't sign over the rights of the script. And hell wants to involve the WG, Eh? Like some kind of fucking weakling. Yes, yes, that's that's I don't see the parallel discussed man. Do you know not a no man? No. No, you don't see any parallel. My dad has cancer. That's what I'm texting you about. That's what I'm That's the big thing going on in my life right now. You guys right now, I think probably want me to sign over the rights. The screenplay agree that I won't arbitrate with the WG, Eh? Just like a similar document. What? Sean made me sign for the 75 25 split we have in our salary. Now. Now this may seem odd. I guess that I was so against Guzman had bringing up your dad at the previous scenes that I had written him into this later seed. Yeah, the reason I was upset that's cause me and improvised that about your father is only because it's supposed to be a reveal in the film. I thought that we would have used him to leverage you. I here I thought it was moral outrage on my behalf. Yes, I understand why it may be felt that way at the time. But you just want Teoh play with the podcast going into that area that it deceived a little too kind of ghoulish even for us. But that's not the case, because I wanted it to be even worse later. And that is why I was upset. And I just want to make that point now, because you at the beginning it seemed like you didn't want anything in the area of cancer. Just that that to me, that's not even really a joke, that it's just like dark and gross for dark and grosses sake. But actually, I just thought there was a more effective way to do it, which is that? I guess we are turned on by your dads dead body, which weve dragged out to show you when we're holding you over the cliff by your throat and masturbating on you. And we wanted to be clear that what is arousing us to the point where we are capable Just polluting under your face is that we have your dads carcass next to us on the rocks at the edge of the cliff. And you were just upset. That's Kezman kind of tip that Well, it is not a good storytelling and scuzz man, you know, better wanting to introduce that line. Sorry, man, I'm just really excited about where weve taken this script. You know, I'm just I'm just like I mean, I just It's just been with working with you, you know, we cracked it open like an egg way. Didn't get to that joke. No, we didn't wind up saying it in the scenes that we read, but it is on basically every page and usually more than butts way. Just skipped over that we just got lucky, I guess. Yeah, we sort of cherry picked the scenes to somehow avoid that Well, look, I mean, obviously you guys, can you guys know I'm not happy about it. Munn, if you really want me to sign over my claim to the screenplay, I will. You know, it's Ah. Oh! Oh, jeez, I guess. Ah, Scotsman, Did you even I mean, we werent even thinking that, but because, I mean, would you be cool with that? Yeah. I mean, you werent even thinking that. No, I havent had that. I didn't.
