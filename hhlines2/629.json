I think of Deadpool says it can be.

What''s the technique? So let''s I'm going to give an example. Okay, So what, Say a topic you might not want to make a joke about, say, abortion clinic abortion clinic. Yeah, that''s over the line, right? You can't make a joke about that like, but check this out abortion clinic.
