And he said, Hey, this is like a canvas for, like, painting. It's white in that same Away. And so what if this were a space Sean? Space for the entire Internet to come and, like, do design's and expres's themselve's and like, right ideas. And it, like, could be a space where, like everyone on Internet, could kind of come together and create this incredible like a mural of ideas and drawings. And it could be this way well understand each other a little better. Ah, and it could be a way to get a piece. And so he advertised.
