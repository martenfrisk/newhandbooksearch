We talked about his television appearances from the Wire to the brand new show The Deuce and also the debut of Drop the Mic, which is a show that I created and co executive produced on TBS debuts October 24th at 10 30. It''s where celebrities rap battle against each other, and I swear to you, it''s better than that sounds. I promise you that. But listen, you could download our episode now at Apple Podcast's on the Earwolf network and listen to an engaging conversation. Sort of candid.
