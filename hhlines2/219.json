And at the very last last minute. I was kind of brought in to replace the lead actor, and it was supposed to be my big break and then it kind of publicly went away. And a lot of people, you know, you can't really find that show. It doesn't exist. Comedy Central doesn't really allow it to be out in the world, and there's always been many rumors about the backstage stuff, and we kind of went all in for the first time and spoke publicly about a lot of my demons addictions. And did I come up at all? Um, not on the show, but I mean, I don't want to fan any flames. But as soon as we were done taping, he's did stand up and he took his headphones off and he threw them down and he was like, Sean could never do that. Shawn could never do that. He throws him down like a touchdown spike, like he''s happy with what he did or like just a mad throw. It was I would I would say The phrase that comes into my mind is more like animal adrenaline. I don't think he meant to throw them. I think he was. He was in a He was acting on impulse. OK, right. OK, so that''s just pure energy coming out of him. And he said, I could never do that. No, he said You He said Sean could never do. Sean could. Yes. He didn't say I do that. No, he''s Hayes said, Sean never. Yes, yes. Is Sean speaking? Yes. And I'm saying what you're saying. Hey said you're Chris us? Yes. And he said Sean could never do. Yes. Yeah, we're on the same page. Mm. How does that make me feel? So that''s the only time I came up. And then what did you say? You probably defended me and said, I think he could. I think that when I kept quiet, I mean, he was really It was like, really like, um, like, you know, like there was a violence to it. There was a violence and an emotion to, and I just tried to say that I brought you a before and asked where you were actually known you much longer. Well, I was going to say, Isn't it strange to do an episode of haze when meanwhile, weve known each other longer? Probably better. Oh, you and there was a stretch of life where you and I were very, very, very close. Yeah, and did he Was he able to deal with that? Uh, I brought it. I said I asked where you were. I said that You and I Really, I mean, this is not in any way exaggerated. You and I, for many years were very, very tight on, and I asked. I said I was really looking forward to the chance to catch up with Sean. I feel like we lost touch a little bit. I've always regretted that. And, uh, he said, Really, this was before the mikes run. And then he said you had something else to dio. I asked what, and he said, I'd rather not tell you. I have a feeling it could make you feel bad if you knew that Sean opted to do that thing over what? Over this. And then did he do any kind of hand gesture's to indicate what it was I was doing? Uh, he he did a number of hand gesture's, but I have to say I'm not neces'sarily trained in perceiving what his hand gesture's mean. But he was. It''s funny that you say that? Cause he was gesturing his hands wildly as he was going. He was doing one of these. A little bit of this. A little. Yeah, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sort of sticking his hands around. Yeah, he''s Now wrong. Anyway, did you guys talk about politics at all or anything? No, mostly It was about about the show. Yeah, I told him a lot because, you know, he had seen a lot and he had been there for a lot. And many, many rumors about my behavior and Big Lake. So I told him about some of the addictions. I fell into a lot of the sex for money. Different, you know, things I was inhaling, injecting back in those days, a lot of demons. I told him a lot about how my character overtook my personality. And this Josh Franklin character kind of came to dominate my mind and live inside my brain in a way where Josh Franklin controlled my thoughts in my action. Ah, yes. Not unlike the Joker. Yeah, Yeah. Very similar. Yeah. Uh, so Okay. Interesting. You really did not listen to even a minute. I just I just couldn't I have to say for people who heard that one tuning back into the same podcast's just to hear you recap the bullet point Recap of recap I have a prior recent episode of the same. You don't think that''s gonna be a real thrill? I would have to imagine. A lot of people are remembering the more fully fleshed out version's of the jokes were Now just describing in simple terms. So if I so OK, so if I clear on what you're saying, if I'm clear on what you're saying, I don't think there''s a single laugh for them to be had so far in this episode because it''s really just a dry retailing oven episode.
