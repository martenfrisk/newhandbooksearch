Even if I agreed, Even if I agreed with you guys. And like, no one wants to just read. Yeah, back what they just saw looking on that I'm clicking on it. I see. Like why Sean Hayes actually got boned by by Adam Powley. Yeah, you have to click even if it's just to make myself mad, which I think it would. Yeah, exactly. And then, like, I might do a thing where I'm like. So apparently Hayes and John think that they just phoned Adam Palley Question mark. And that''s rhetorical. You know, I kind of right to my audience conversation, and then I might put a chip in. Some people call him gifts, but, you know, I've been in the game a long time. Their gifts of, like, you know, ah, cartoon character puke ing into a bucket. You know something? That''s kind of the images Might The answer my rhetorical question, which is I disagree, And it makes me sick that they would think that that they would think that anyone would like to be on podcast's. Wow. Yeah, that''s just like a fun. And so people people reading it are made because I think what''s fun is that you read Recaps been like, OK, I just listen to podcast They pone Palley Suddenly I come in with my laser, right? And the readers like I think Palley phoned them. And what does that do to your So to be such a faker and, uh, not be any cuter and to be doing tricks on the Internet that your mom could be reading? Yeah. I mean, um, I had toe walk away for that reason, you know, caused a lot of stuff outside. Even my profes'sional. I was I was unhappy From I didn't like food or TV anymore.
