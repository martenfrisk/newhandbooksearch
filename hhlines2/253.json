Yes. Um, that's kind of been the traditional way that the podcast industrie's operated is you either make money off doing a live show, or if you want a merchandiser show and have shirts, then you don't have any live shows. And so here we run into this problem, which is you go to a show and you have no share or you put on your shirt and you sit down and wear it anywhere. Yes. And no one sees it. Yes. So what weve decided to do. Hayes and I are known for disrupting $1,000,000,000 tech industrie's. And yet again, uh, we're going to just shatter the norms and say, We have shirts. Yes. And you can wear them to our show. And our show is basically a shirt show. Yeah, where everyone who wears our shirt to the show and buys a ticket will get into the show. Exactly. It''s a special promotion that we're doing Where if you wear the shirt, obviously there''s limited. I mean, you know, we have to put a cap on it. Sure, they're only enough people as there is tickets can have a fis'sure in the show, but both can be done by you if you're in time. So we are announcing the shirt showdown, which is you go to pot swag dot com and you by our new shirt that says Nice and smart and cool and funny and being nice. And it''s in the style of those like shirts that nobody copyrighted it. So everyone that''s just like it was just completing Off Molly Deluded. Yeah, uh, and then it says The Boys on it as well, and it''s on pots white dot com, and so is part of the shirt showdown. You buy the shirt you go to wear. Where do they buy a ticket? Chef Kevin Ah Dynasty-Typewriter. If you Google at and then Hollywood Handbook The tickets air there, it''s only two quick Google searches away on. So that''s on Friday, April 13th. It''s in Los Angeles, which is where Ah, a lot of our fans live and this says, and you can travel there, join us for an exclusive live V I P backstage pas's in the 10 potential towns politics. Did you write this? Now? Why does it say that they get a backstage pas's. I think their life show they accidentally put your show description in this life description, which is like not a good cros'sover, because nobody is going Vietcombank Stage Pas's for a live show is an unfortunate terminology, because people will think that. What if I had just read that and not realize how stupid it was his into Tinseltown''s politics? But really, what it sounds like is that they're going to get to it.
