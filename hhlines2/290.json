Is it because weve talked so much about brighter franking sons and they're not in the scene? No, I Well, I feel like that's a different moves Movie is this Yahoo''s movie is those movies. You guys beat me to it again. So this is just because I don't understand the busine'ss like you guys. The fact that you beat me to my own question shows me that I just don't understand just operating Off The template of the mummy. Yeah. You know, you're starting out. Here''s a guy. He''s not a mummy. Then there is a girl. She''s a mummy. Maybe this guy becomes the mummy, but the whole center of the movie is somehow about Dr Jekyll''s laboratory. Got it.

Who''s movie is that? Yeah, it is. This a movie? Okay, so OK, so then I'm not that okay, if you know, you are exactly where we want Teoh be. So when you're asking me how I'm going to fight off the invisible man, it felt like a, you know, a psychological thriller at that point of a man just dealing with his own emotions. Yeah, that we couldn't see rather than a fight scene. Because I was thinking there is no end up being much conflict. Yeah, because I was looking Yeah. Yeah. Enough of this. Of all this like, yeah, you know, battling. You know, with these month eyes something that weve found to be expensive, hard to shoot got hurt it hurt? You're hurting, you know, like people are getting hurt. Is that what you meant? Hurting it is, uh way we would put it Is that it is being hurting to do it. Okay, being hurting. Uh, yeah, There''s some huge out She''s have been sustained through some of these early Audible Korea. Okay, Yeah, because that''s what my mind was like. Oh, if you're gonna fight the invisible man, I was thinking of that scene From Crank where he like, you know, there''s oil all over the place, so you can't see him. But you would see his footprints. Runners with rain. Oh, no. The ratchet and cranks been Off movie. Oh, um ah, you're The of crank. You think of crying and you think your ratchet and clank The video game? Yes.
