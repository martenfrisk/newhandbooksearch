And it helped us develop this little friendship despite the fact that the head writer was sort of aggres'sively positioning me against the writers, which again was one of the aspect's that I think led to a lot of Ah, you know, like the backstage drama and my physical and mental emotional deterioration.

Well, you know, im I mentioned a mention tee up top that he's it said shard could never do this. And I would say that thus far, maybe too much of a voice. This is maybe more than I need, Like he's had mentioned. Like, Sean could never do that. I never do what I just did. And I would say, based on what we're proving together thus far, it seems like it is in some ways maybe proving his as'sertion true. Okay, well, all right, well, and it''s okay. I'm hearing you so all right, Maybe I couldn't do exactly what he did. Just because, like you said, a lot of people can't find Big Lake. I know there was like, Ah, Lee, Harvey Oz world was like an amusement park with that show episode that Hayes wrote. That was the episode Hayes Room. Great joke at the end. Great visual that he and I talked about that that came up on the show it did at. Yeah, well, I couldn't do exactly what he could do. Ah, but, you know, you're doing a podcast of me. Here''s what you're gonna get fun. Talk about movies. A really original observation about sports. Um, politics. I mean, do you want to dig in? It? Honestly, feels more like a circus, then, like, ah, presidential race. Yeah. I'm happy to talk about all those the clowns. Yeah. And you're saying right now that we're gonna talk about those things like you and I Not just in the context of did Hayes and I talk about them and it didn't come up with you guys know I'm saying it. That is what we would talk about if it was just me doing it. And you and he's had never done one Big. In light of the fact that you did do one. I do really need to get the context. Yeah. Yeah. You know, just because I'm not gonna be able to listen to the episode. You know, my Bluetooth has been weird s Oh, I can't release into it in my car. And I get that. Yeah. I think my cousin Sam deactivated my Bluetooth. Ah, when he was in my car. And so I do need to kind of know what got covered. Yeah. And you're saying that es'sentially Big Lake was a show? Ah, you did get your mind affected by the Joker, Josh. Frankly, did you at any point say, why are you being so serious? No, I didn't. I didn't quote No, I didn't quote the joke. Yeah. Yeah. And I also don't think that''s a quote. What he was Hear.

Well, I'm sure you you promoted him in a way that you like, Why don't you? Why doesn't he like you? Okay, well, there''s a world where maybe perhaps there was an ad read that was done for his album by I gues's me in somehow Case wasn't involved in that one. That maybe some people interpreted it as being not the best way to read it out for something. So he paid you money to promote his product. And you did it in a fashion that underwhelmed. Yeah, I gues's that would be his side of the story. Sure. Well, at the very least, he must be happy right now because he''s now getting double bang for his buck because it''s coming up for this one.
