If you've been listening to the show, you know that Sean has an is'sue with Disneyland, where it''s a few different things. He was once he went on Space Mountain and in the photo has sweatshirt flew up over his head, and he wasn't wearing anything under. And he has, like, sort of discolored nipples. And it was very popular selling photo. It''s Space Mountain and is still the most popular item at Disneyland. Um, he also has a thing with Goofy, where hey thinks that Goofy thinks that he is funnier than Sean and has embarras'sed Sean on several occasion's comedically at Disneyland. So this is a thing with and you know, he doesn't want to go to Anna to dio the festival. So after right after we recorded this episode, Sean uh told me that he was going back to Disney Land toe sort of conquer his fear. I gues's he didn't say it that way. Ah, but I think that''s sort of what it''s about. Congres's Hear going to enter. So he went, and it's first It''s late September. So it''s Halloween themed Now. They're doing like their Halloween time thing, which he thought was done just for him, like just to scare him personally. But he texted me that he, like, wasn't scared. But it seemed like, um, I'll just read, Just read his text. So we get the Disneyland and he hey, text at Disney Bland. That''s what he''s been calling it recently. Sucks, not cool. That''s the first time. And then he taxed. They made it scary for me. Too bad I'm not scared, then just got surprised by a Jackal enter, but not really. Then I see goofy. He''s got vampire teeth and a cape. Not funny. And so then I text him. Don't talk to Goofy, but he doesn't. He doesn't really acknowledge the receipt that his phone received tax. I don't know if he knows that it has that functionality. I think he thinks It''s just a sender. A text sender. So then he writes going to go van helping on him. I think that''s that. I think it''s also even housing.
