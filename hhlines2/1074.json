Um, I should say why he is not here to do ads this week. Um, he, as we have mentioned, has been ordering all these contacts that are painted, um, to es'sentially transform him through his eyes into whatever at, like a b A, which a toad, a cheetah, basically wherever his imagination takes him. And this was very fun for him for a little while, but I gues's he got kind of bored with that. And he has started taking these painted contacts and grafting them all over different parts of his body in order to confuse predators. Like I said, he has told me what some animals do in nature is they get thes, they have these eyes all over them, and then the predators come up to them and they don't know something. He's something he said is if a predator comes up to me, then it looks like I'm looking at it out. Might, but because he has most of the azure on it. But, um, but I think there was an is'sue with him not encountering enough predators in his sort of daily routine. So he has been going to the zoo a lot and kind of slinking around the different cages, especially the cage where they keep the owls. And I was like, Is that really a predator? Is not like a huge predator. But, he pointed out, I gues's they eat mice and stuff, so I gues's it technically is. But and I said, You know, I tried to make a little joke and I was like, Well, I easy Teoh Can Alcon Fuser Most confused animal? They're always saying who and he hated that They need him really mad for a reason. I still I'm not really sure why. Eso anyway Simple Contacts you take a quick, self guided vision test from your phone or computer. It will be reviewed by a licensed doctor in 24 hours. You used to be able to choose what animal you wanted to be, but I think theyve kind of caught wind of this Sean stuff so they don't offer that anymore. Then you will receive a renewed prescription that you can reorder your contacts. Simple prices are unbeatable. The vision test is only $20 compared to employment, without which insurance could cost up to $200. Though this is not a replacement for your periodic full eye health exam. Uh, best of all, anyone who hears this gets $20 off their first Simple Contacts order.
