Whats Randa? We watch these commercials and we watched. We watched computers and we watch all this stuff and the thing. One of the Rando rules. The thing that's so random that we love when we see it is stuff about riding unicorns. Dude, Unicord arent riel. So the fact that you see a unicorn, but not just that somebody is riding somebodys writing it and it's like something. Usually, if you really want to step it up, something should be coming out of its butt. Oh, right. And their casual about it. The persons writing it and they're not saying, Hey, I'm writing to you Corn. How this happened. What they're saying is like past me, the Skittles. Yeah, because a and what is usually coming out of the uniforms. But if you're really doing a good Rando is rain both. Yeah, rainbow shoots out. Sometimes money. It flies up, you know, flies and pails a lepre con on the horn, and then you go like OK, so if that's one thing that's really than the other things real, too, and it's killing it so funny or like sometimes in the animal space, two different animals are fighting each other. And that can be also super Rando. Oh, yeah. Um and then they talk to each other. Huh? You cannot do that. So, Rando, if the animals sitting there, it's like the last thing I expect is he's gonna talk. Yeah, like a ninja bear. Oh, God. I'm laughing at the bear. Does this Ah, samurai sword move.

I'm just like, OK, just roll me up and put me in the casket already, because I'm just dying, laughing, And it's like, you know, I see that and I'm buying those cookies. Yeah, and I've got to eat him too, And And I would say one thing that's major Rando that I have been loving lately is like a Lou Ferrigno. Yeah, like a weird celebrity. You It's so fucked up that it's like, where? Okay, Ugo, you are? Yeah. Where have you been? Or like, a Mr T? Or like, a guy whos, like, pretty tough and Oh, yeah, but what he's doing is like having a tea party with, like, a fucking ah teddy bear. Oh, yeah. If It's a fucking tough wrestler, and he's doing something that, like a pussy, would do like a real little bitch. And he's fucking doing it like it's OK. I'm like Rando enough to see him, but to have him doing something. Rando. Hello, Surprise and laughing on. Then, At that point, I'm like, E I'm going to use this car insurance. Um, and in the same world is like maybe an actor we forgot. What if you're like commercial is like, uh, like, basically looks just like a TV show that hasnt even been on for, like years.
