Casper is asleep. Brand that continues to revolutionize it's line of products. To create an exceptionally comfortable sleeping is no kidding. One night of no kidding and so breaking news, Casper is a great Mattres'ses. I have heard that before, and I heard in my sleep I was sleeping. How do we get this scoop? Yeah, No, it's the oldest story. It''s It''s literally the greatest story ever told all this tale. It''s alleged that we all know the models of the Casper-Mattres'ses The Wave, The es'sential ah, and the original Casper are basically The three archetypes that you see over and over again in storytelling. Joseph Gamble talked about thes Mattres'ses, But one thing that we didn't neces'sarily discu'ss before because we're so focused on the Amazing Night''s sleep you can get, is that these are really good Mattres'ses, Teoh. A good firm mas'sage on. And just for people to really dig in and hit all the points so you can sleep on it at night on your back. But what about during the day when the sun comes up, you're looking at this thing you like. What is this like? I just throw it away. No, you keep it. And they have technology. Now, uh, that you can now cut a hole in the mattres's for your face and stick your face through and still be able to breathe and see the shoes of the person who''s standing above you and is really digging in and getting all the points and giving a firm Mas'son s. So instead of getting up and throwing it away, you can stay on it all day. Getting a mas'sage, whether it''s your scaling, is your Rahm Boyd''s your cue allergy, Aurelio. So as that means a little extra attention, just call me a word. Oh, yes, sorr sorr sartorius. And that''s The Taylor muscle which actually articulates From one of your hip points all the way down acros's on the opposite side of the knee. And so if you picture a tailor, sort of with their one leg cros'sed over their knee up in the air so that they can do the stitching on the surface. They're activating that muscle and take what someone could do on a Casper mattres's is just go all the way down and get on the inside and touch it. So you do want to cut a new hole every time you do this, cause your face was all rubbed up in the original hole. Obviously, your face is gros's and you have to radio up the whole. So yeah, when you get up, you're gonna find that your face has produced a lot of stuff that has filled the whole Hayes and I came into this. Yes, it''s great, because then when you go to sleep again, there''s not a hole in your mattres's. But you're gonna have to cut a new hole ideally in a different place, because what happens to the first hole is it does start to grow stuff. So, uh, get a $50 you know thing towards select Mattres'ses by visiting Casper dot com slash The Boys and using the Boys at check out that''s Casper dot com slash The Boys offer code. The Boys for $50 off your Mataric comes in a box, and you can sleep in it for 100 nights. Risk free, free trial. And I think you can cut as many holes in it as you want and still give it back. And I just want t think I want sure about a little bit to my unboxing experience, which it was really easy. It was really cool. It felt great. But what happened to me is I'm very weak and I hurt myself during the Unboxing. And so I needed a good firm mas'sage right afterwards. And so I got down there and I called up engineer Cody and he was able to dig in, and he didn't even really need to use lube or anything because he''s so slimy. And he gave me one of the firmest mas'sages I've ever had. And he was able to dig in and hooked his thumbs and his fingers and sort of a pinch into my sub occipital muscle's and almost felt like he was gonna pull my skull right Off.
