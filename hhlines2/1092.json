And you need somebody to go break all the door knobs off a house so that the person needs to hire you. And you need somebody very stealthy. And so you don't want to put your job listing on just one website because then you only get just the people who go to that website literally, just that one. And maybe you get somebody who ends up getting you arrested because they are not sneaky like Hayes and like me. Um and so you don't want to go to jail and get arrested, do you? Doorknob salesman?

You can quickly screen candidates, rate them, hire them fast, find out today why theyve been used by over a 1,000,000 busine'sse's, and one busine'ss that hasn't used them actually so far has been Earwolf and theyll start using them now because we're doing the ad and they listen to us, but they didn't use them before. And some of the people they hired this one lady named Dana. I mean, you guys don't know where it doesn't mean anything. You she works, Hear. She''s like a freakin corporate robot psycho path who only cares about numbers and the bottom line. And I heard the way they even hired her is she did a psychological test for the government, and they said you could either go work it Earwolf or be a as'sas'sin because she has no conscience. And, um and I think she actually does both because a lot of time she takes a long lunch and she comes back and she''s out of breath like maybe she was doing as'sas'sinations anyway. Ah, that''s day. And I hope she doesn't listen to this.
