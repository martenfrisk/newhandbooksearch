You should, because a lot of people physically go in with an eraser, and it''s like, we're gonna break into the desert hole, and it doesn't work on a movie in my experience, right? You can't. You can't raise him to be like on a computer screen, either. Eggs. I've been trying to erase a lot of my past ago of the sites where I'm registered on and I'm going like, I don't really want people to see this. And I'm ready. And my experience, you cannot do it that way. Ran in my experience. You can Oh, wow. But don't do it right is pos'sible, but impos'sible. Okay. Anything is pos'sible. Wow. I know. And that''s something I learned from working at Adidas also what impos'sible is also nothing. But when I was working on Cliffhanger, people were like, Hey, I don't dare you to keep working on this dangerous movie. And I said, Okay, well, how about I dare myself, Gas'ser, You did that to yourself and, you know, like I won a Tony for that movie. Yes, sir. You won the award. What does it feel like for a man to dare himself and win the Tony for that movie? I mean, it was invigorating because it is always my dream to wake up one day. And when the Tony Parker Award Wow, are That''s right. That ceremony, that''s their money is in the morning. Yeah. Yeah. And like, the weird thing about it is like you go to the awards, and it''s like you wear the tux and there''s the glitz and the glamour. And then, you know, you get inside and you think they're just gonna put you in the seats. Yeah. So you thought that Yeah, but they put a harnes's on you and hanging from the ceiling and you watch the show? No, see, and it''s like, Oh, okay. I like those early award shows Because then you still have your whole day once it''s over, you know, like you can actually do your own stuff. Yeah, well, you know, the the slogans of the award show is come early so you can hang out later. Well, we were laughing. Do were like, when you're up there, you're like, OK, alright. Wrote this and get it up. You have to give a writer''s name was Cliff, and I was like, Wow, this is just like, is this coincidence? Is this you know? Yeah, dog, that was in green It I was seven, but it was just like, OK, Cliff Bemis was the head writer of the show within the show on the grinder. Yeah. Yeah, I know how many of these words is you're talking. What? Which percentage, The words do you know? Yeah, which under you just kind of gas'sing. And which ones are you like? Fully knowing what they mean, right? Well, let let it we're gonna go with Do you want to go with percentages or like, an actual count? Because the last sentence I said I knew three words. Okay. Oh, wow. And it was a long sentence. It was a run on action, so Yeah, so that''s gotta be Wow, you're functioning. Such a high level. Just cold gues'sing What sounds you should make with your mouth at almost every turn. Yeah. So it''s like that I'm good at that. I'm also good at cup stacking. Those are the two things that, like, I've That''s Big Man has picked up. Yeah, I just picked that up. That''s the future of entertainment. Really? Because weve kind of tapped into almost every other avenue. Obviously, people arent going to be watching TV. You're going Teoh Peter anymore. But cops stacking cups down, and it''s getting democratized to the point where it used to be like the just the ivory Tower cup stackers. But now you see lots of people, just like kids were doing there was such a barrier to entry before. You are really People were only allowed to have two or three cups, right? And now it''s like where I think my last count. I saw seven Wow. And I was like, OK, rebuilding the pyramid. Yeah. And how many of those air you able to actually stack me? Seven. Yeah, for okay. The sad thing is that I don't know how to stack From. So it actually is just two cups with two cups under them. Okay, I can picture this. Yeah, that''s pretty strong. So when you see that you're, like, others to couple in table and then I'm to be like nights, actually is like a sculpture, so Okay, we are going to take a break now. Um, is there anything you want a plug before we go to the break? Um, yeah, I, uh, again, a lot of people? No, that I work at g E s o actually, weirdly wanna plug surge protectors.
