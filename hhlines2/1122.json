And I won't say what help put up today because he's was nasty about me saying that on an episode. And I don't know if you heard that one. How did you hear it? He was nasty about it on the episode with Tom Sharpening. I don't know if he thought I I wouldn't be able to hear it because I wasn't there, but I listened. And the thing he usually says is the title I just did, which I came up with, right. It''s like he''s taking credit. For what? Up what up? Like that''s this great. You know, he could say it, too.
