Say, hey, shook up a guys chef kevin here. So Chef, Kevin is gonna tell you. So what they're saying what Squarespace is saying. Okay, so products and services, just a few clicks customize everything From looking field to settings and products using beautiful templates created by world clas's designer's.

And the new thing I'm doing is even better and even mawr great. And I think, uh will help more people, probably than Squarespace The Don't you agree, Kevin? 100%. So my new website is called Earwolf dot com, and it''s so, so cool, and you can go in there and build your own website on their way easier than Squarespace because what you have to do with Squarespace is have an idea. Pick out what it looks like. Put all your stuff on, but mine is better because you can build this website where your listening, you know, Ah, quitter in the garbage or you're listening to violin. Garland right and I've sort of, you know, uh, done some of the leg work for you where there''s a template there. Ah, that will have a picture of the guest's on the episode.
