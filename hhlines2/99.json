I'm Sean Clements IV telling you about this show on this streaming platform. Tune in to see if Diane Lockhart will lead the resi'stance in a new post factual world with lawyers with the best stories triumph over the lawyers with the best facts. Sound familiar? Now, in honor of the CBS all acces's show The Good Fight, I am going to tell you guys about one good fight I have had with my co host, Hayes, who''s not here every time I read an ad for them. So, uh, one fight that we had was when we were in Chicago, we were on our way running a little bit late, actually, to get to the theater for sound check to do or show at that onion festival, and we were walking. And we're walking by this coffee place that had a specific kind of coffee that I like and we had already called Ah, car service. Teoh, come pick us up one of the big APs And he's had done it on his phone and I said, uh, sorry. Do I have time to just stop in for coffee real quick? And he in a tone that I did not like, went No, you don't. And I was like, Hey, f you, you know, because I just didn't like he sort of scoffed. And then, um, I got in the car with him and we went all the way to the theater. And then I walked out to get a coffee right next to the theater, and I really didn't like it wasn't very good. And I knew that I could have had that other one. We were about to do these two shows in front of a big group of people that I was pretty nervous about. And little things like having the coffee I want make me feel more comfortable before something like that. And so I was mad at him and being snippy and I was on, like, Day eight of, like, a 10 day course of prednisone, which, um, was to treat acute fair in J tous also something that, you know, I was like, I have to talk to all these people in my throat is mes'sed up, but it was making me not sleep well. I was irritable and and sweaty, and, um, anyway, that''s a really good fight that we had where I was like, if you don't say that to me that we don't have enough time and he said, Well, I call the car The car was gonna leave in two minutes. We were running late to the feet already, and I said, But I didn't get the coffee I wanted and he said he didn't realize that was so important to me. Anyway. It''s all fine now, and that''s a good fight. But there''s even better ones on the show. The Good Fight on CBS All Acces's Christine Baranski is back as the venerable Diane Lockhart, along with Cush, Jumbo Rose, Leslie, Sarah Steele and Audra McDonald. Delroy Lindo delivers another can't mis's performance while actor Michael Sheen shakes up the screen is infamous lawyer Roland Bluhm. New characters New ripped off the headlines. Storylines. New um ah dynamic cast? Well, no, I mean, not all of them are new. Some of them, you know, and you like already dynamic, casted so much more this season, the standard playbook goes out the window. So if you're tuning and for the standard playbook, it''s there. But it''s not being treated that nicely because it''s going out the window. Talk about how stacked the cast is, it says. Well, how about Christine Baranski, Cush, Jumbo Rose, Leslie, Sarah Steele, Audra McDonald and Delroy Lindo delivering another can't mis's performance, with actor Michael Sheen shaking up the screen anyway.
