Our fearles's leader here in Earwolf gave us a little bit of ah, directive where he said, Guys, you have to have an evergreen episode, you have to record one where there''s no specifics. You don't talk about anything political, any of the movies, any pop culture stuff now because we need tohave something in the chamber ready to be released. So we want to do this evergreen episode. It''s September 2016 now, but way want September 8th? Yes, but we want to really be able to release this. Hey, any time in case on the bad? Yes, something bad. You know, he's and I are on the same flights a lot. Stuff like that where he goes, like in case something happens where you guys either can't release an episode and we need time to prepare a statement about how, um your dad you're in a coma. Your don't exist anyway because it would have to be that because we will always like we do the show we love what ends too much We love our family will never not do the show. We did the show when it was raining your during the reign. Once we did the show, I was when I when I was snorkeling in the lake, remember? And I surfaced right where a duck had just pooped Yeah, and some of it got in his mask got in the way of the mask. And two days later, I did do the show. Yeah, he didn't barely talked about.
