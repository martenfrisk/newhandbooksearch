That was annoying. I mean, you know, Look, I don't This This is a segment. Ham is called this Hamilton segment. Just call it Hamilton are Just handle shit out of me. Is it too late to make our brand that we like Hamilton is anyone else tried to do that? I mean, I think people I've seen that attempted I've seen what happens first. You know the guy first. Do you know Hamilton first Or do you like it first and then he knows you. Does a guy find out you like it somehow? I think that''s I think that''s probably what it is like. He sees his fans and engages with them. OK, it''s one or the other thing about Lin Manuel Miranda, Not him again. Hamilton references Alexander Hamilton The historical figure. Okay, It''s not like there isn't like a modern guy. Didn't know. But I just Asian once you guys again and he''s looking for notes on the segments. Or do you just want to like, Do you like that one? What I think about my voice, I mean, look, I like you. I liked it because I'm thinking it''s, as you say, a shorter olden times. So I kind of did like a cool old guy s. I did where it kind of dragged. Yeah, that''s true. Um, want to tighten it up? I think it should be like 1/3 as long as it was I think a yeah. Maybe it could be shorter. Or maybe just rethink whether you or not, you want to do a segment specific toe, Hamilton, which is I get and I'm get. I'm not gonna. And I turned accused enough Sam''s that may be cut out some of that annoying sound he was playing. Yeah, again, I think. And I havent seen it, but I believe Sam was actually playing some of the musical Hamilton you're playing from the original cast recording. Okay, so that was Hamilton. And meanwhile, what you guys were doing, it sounded like Hayes was singing of from the soundtrack to Nightmare before Christma's. This is Halloween. Replacing Halloween with this is Hamilton. That was what? Yeah, that''s what that is. So if you don't like that, you probably don't like Hamilton. Do we know? Do we know him now? Is it pos'sible that now we are friends? That''s what I'm worried about. Gonna hear me wondering because usually when I come into this stuff on social media, all the people who like it are already friends with them. Yes, that is what''s confusing. He''s being like this. So now I wonder if we have cros'sed that bridge and now we're friends of Yeah, they're going like, Hey, I'm here to see it. Can I get in or something? But like he''s and here''s me and him afterwards. Is there a picture it''s like with him and share the show? That''s interesting. Does that exist now? I mean, if you havent taken it, and I don't remember taking it. But how is it pos'sible that all these other people did? Yeah, and not me. It was like like some of these people looking like this guy. What? Like not me? That seems impos'sible. So I have another segment idea, Okay, that we might want to sort of sort through. Right. And this is It''s basically and I don't know, exact. But you know how I talked about going down these Wikipedia rabbit holes before? Do you remember that one of you? What? I remember. What if you what If you're going down and you read the Wikipedia of, like, some of the most twisted, like, fucked up shit that''s ever happened? Like frickin Maryland Manson freakin What are the freakin bad guys? And then you sort of half remember what you read in Wikipedia and you talk about it with your friend way. Don't read it during way. Have read the article A long time ago. We read a day before. Yeah, some freaky stuff like cousin it. It sounds like you're talking about some sort of true crime. You're can do a true crime thing. But what You've referenced Marilyn Manson and cousin it. Marilyn Manson is a musician cousin. It is a member of the Adams family, so I mean I mean, I gues's I gues's you could talk about these things that are, like horror and pop culture. Or maybe that''s the thing. You could be a beast from Beauty and the beast, huh? You mean the beast from Beauty and the Beast is that we're referencing Kelsey. Kelsey Grammer is role in X Men three where he played the beast. I mean, beast. I mean, I'm reading that, and then I'm going like, he's do You even remember like that? He had to spend 2.5 hours in make up every morning, and that was before they applied The for and he''s going like, Oh, shit. Imagine that happened.
