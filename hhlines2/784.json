Sean had gone before to Disneyland to sort of addres's his fear of the place in advance of the festival in Anaheim after an incident in it's based mountain in the late seventies early eighties, when he went on the ride and his sweatshirt full up on his nipples were exposed for the picture, and his nipples were very red. Plus, he had a conversation with Goofy earlier, where Goofys jokes were funnier than His's. So he has always hated Disney land. So he went face his fear. Saw Guv Iguchi''s dres'ses a vampire because it''s Halloween time. Sean texted me that he was going to go Van Helsing, God, goofy. And then three hours later, he text me that I had to pick him up from jail. So I go to Disneyland. Sean is in the jail in the frontier Land shooting range. He has, like, a little laser sensor on him, and when you shoot the sensor what he was like, mechanically compelled. He has all these, like mechanical Roeder''s and gears attached to him and his arms. When you shoot the center, his arms lift up his sweatshirt and they expose his nipples and then a bunch of ants, I think also mechanical. They made a lot of mechanical noise's, but they crawl up his pants and up to his nipples because the ants think his nipples are red hot. It says It''s on like a plaque that the ants think that his nipples are red hearts for Arab hand red hot candy because they're so red and they're also very, very large. And so he''s being munched on by these ants, and he keeps saying he''s like, sort of half crying. But he''s also excited because he keeps saying like, This is like, This is like Westworld. It''s just like Westworld, which I gues's it was kind of true because of the robot stuff and cowboy stuff. Uh, but so ultimately, I have to give goofy hug to get Sean out of the Frontierland shooting range, and Sean has been very pis'sy ever since, to me also, I think, because I saw him in that position it makes. It was embarras'sed, and he had to cut the nipples out of the He wears this some this Eddie George Jersey toe watch football and had to cut the nipples because the mesh was scratching his nipples.
