# (New) Seekers' Lounge

Seekers' Lounge is a search engine with the transcripts of episodes of the Teachers' Lounge podcast. This version is updated to use Svelte Kit and MeiliSearch hosted on AWS.

## Usage

You can see the deployed version at seekerslounge.pcast.site
Feel free to download the code here and do whatever you want with it.
Raw transcripts can be found here: https://github.com/martenfrisk/seekerslounge/tree/master/src/transcripts

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

No technical knowledge is needed to help editing the episodes. Just some patience. They don't have to be perfectly edited - just corrected enough to make searching easier. We have completed two episodes so far (s01e01, mini-07).
When you're done, issue a PR or message me here or on reddit u/martanor.
