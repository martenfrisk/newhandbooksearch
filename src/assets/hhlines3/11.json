Um, he, as we have mentioned, has been ordering all these contacts that are painted, um, to es'sentially transform him through his eyes into whatever at, like a b A, which a toad, a cheetah, basically wherever his imagination takes him. And this was very fun for him for a little while, but I gues's he got kind of bored with that. And he has started taking these painted contacts and grafting them all over different parts of his body in order to confuse predators. Like I said, he has told me what some animals do in nature is they get thes, they have these eyes all over them, and then the predators come up to them and they don't know something. He's something he said is if a predator comes up to me, then it looks like I'm looking at it out. Might, but because he has most of the azure on it. But, um, but I think there was an is'sue with him not encountering enough predators in his sort of daily routine. So he has been going to the zoo a lot and kind of slinking around the different cages, especially the cage where they keep the owls. And I was like, Is that really a predator? Is not like a huge predator. But, he pointed out, I gues's they eat mice and stuff, so I gues's it technically is. But and I said, You know, I tried to make a little joke and I was like, Well, I easy Teoh Can Alcon Fuser Most confused animal? They're always saying who and he hated that They need him really mad for a reason. I still I'm not really sure why. Eso anyway Simple Contacts you take a quick, self guided vision test from your phone or computer. It will be reviewed by a licensed doctor in 24 hours. You used to be able to choose what animal you wanted to be, but I think theyve kind of caught wind of this Sean stuff so they don't offer that anymore. Then you will receive a renewed prescription that you can reorder your contacts. Simple prices are unbeatable. The vision test is only $20 compared to employment, without which insurance could cost up to $200. Though this is not a replacement for your periodic full eye health exam. Uh, best of all, anyone who hears this gets $20 off their first Simple Contacts order.

Just saw a guy get the shit beat out of him by, like, six other guy. Wow. Well, tough to say. I was sitting on the hood of someone''s car in the parking lot and I saw a guy walking with his girlfriend and about five guys behind and walking with beer bottles, throwing the bottle caps at him, and he was turning around, going like, Yeah, fuck you, man. Fuck you like? Yeah, I'll fight you sometime. But when it''s me and you not when it''s me and you and all your Boys and the guy was going like All right, all right. And this girl was going Stop, stop! Just stop. And he was like, All right, Book you guys, But you guys and then one guy, so there, about two rows away starts running at, like a pretty solid speed picking up speed as he goes through two rows of cars and then around past me goes right past me. Does this huge arc word that he then runs around in front of him from the other side as The do. They're like talking to him behind him. He gets like a football fields worth of a full sprint going It just lands this flying punch on the guy knocks him down, and then the other four guys have kind of as they're having this argument cornered Off and they close in from all sides and just start kicking the fucking shit out of this guy. And then it happens for 20 seconds, and then they all back off and he gets up and you could just see he has no idea where he is. And he''s kind of trying to walk away and they, like, let him get, like, two steps and then they just fucking closing and do it again. And his girlfriend just screaming. I'm sitting on the car. I've left the concert literally because I am so sick from all the drugs and alcohol in my system. And so I'm just like on my buddy''s car, waiting for them to come out of the concert concerts. Not over. Uh, and I'm like, alone there, and I'm being like, wow, I mean, I'm not. I cannot be involved in this like I should. Ah, hero would help. That''s not what I am. So I watch. And then what was amazing is that almost immediately, an ambulance pulled up and they put the guy in the back of it, and the girlfriend, like, got in with him and drove away and the other guys had disappeared. But I was like, What was the system where they were informed? I didn't do it? I mean, I should have. She didn't do it like, how did they know?

And you need somebody to go break all the door knobs off a house so that the person needs to hire you. And you need somebody very stealthy. And so you don't want to put your job listing on just one website because then you only get just the people who go to that website literally, just that one. And maybe you get somebody who ends up getting you arrested because they are not sneaky like Hayes and like me. Um and so you don't want to go to jail and get arrested, do you? Doorknob salesman? No. You want to go to ZipRecruiter dot com instead? Venue listed on all the top job sites. Yeah, that''s right. Over 100 plus job sites, including social media networks like Facebook and Twitter and all with the single quick click. And you find candidates in any city, even if it''s a city with a crazy name, like some of the names and cities in this country. You guys, I feel like I'm losing touch. The new cities they're coming up with Now their out of control. I saw one city the other day, the name but Montana. You think I'm making it up? It''s real. So anyway, even if you're in but Montana, you can use ZipRecruiter dot com. It''s got an easy interface. You can quickly screen candidates, rate them, hire them fast, find out today why theyve been used by over a 1,000,000 busine'sse's, and one busine'ss that hasn't used them actually so far has been Earwolf and theyll start using them now because we're doing the ad and they listen to us, but they didn't use them before. And some of the people they hired this one lady named Dana. I mean, you guys don't know where it doesn't mean anything. You she works, Hear. She''s like a freakin corporate robot psycho path who only cares about numbers and the bottom line. And I heard the way they even hired her is she did a psychological test for the government, and they said you could either go work it Earwolf or be a as'sas'sin because she has no conscience. And, um and I think she actually does both because a lot of time she takes a long lunch and she comes back and she''s out of breath like maybe she was doing as'sas'sinations anyway. Ah, that''s day. And I hope she doesn't listen to this.
