Ryan Morrison law dot com. You go there, you get a free consultation and you learn how to protect yourself and your hard work. And that's in real life. You do that. You can also do that in my video game. Courtroom scramble where you can play an attorney not named Ryan Morrison the real remorse and worked as a game developer and his company never wanted. Call their attorney cause the phone call was so expensive. E Anyway, that stuff sucks and he's doing the cool way. But the other cool thing is, I'm now working on this one part of the video game where this guy gets up to a object and you friggin slice him, open the and acts off the wall of the It's like a legal acts that's in in the wall of the courtroom. So you've got enough to worry about when it comes to developing your new game. And I do, too. I'm having trouble with the graphics, let alone lawyers charging you an arm and a leg for just legal advice. As a result, youll never be charged for emails, phone calls or anything like that. When working with Ryan, he keeps this open line of communication with all clients, and that and the lawyer in my gamed us too. You are open at any time to hit the smash button. Inhale smash whoevers nearby, on and within the head and all the clients. But okay, so you're free to double and triple check things with him. And since Ryans worked with every size member of the game industry big to small, I'm assuming he knows what to watch out for no matter where you stand in the game development world with Eh, your international success or a national success of your indie developer, or whether you're like me and you're just kind of telling your dad about ideas you've had, and he is not that impressed. Ah, anyway, don't let a fear of lawyers and lawyer fees stand in the way you're successful Game development. Head to Ryan Morris in law dot com and by, uh, uh, courtroom scramble when it comes out and there's gonna be one part, I think if I can figure out how to draw this and right now, the game is on Lee on pieces of paper, mostly, but there's gonna be one part where there's a lady lawyer that you can like give a special kiss to anyway. The other thing you could do is Google video game attorney to find out more by Hegang. You're probably wondering which add is this now and I'm gonna tell you it's a new ad and I'm doing it for Harrys Razors and Shave Club. So, uh, one thing you probably don't know is that the Harry from Harrys razors is, uh, actually Harry from Harry and the Hendersons. It's the same guy, but youd never recognize him because when I saw him now to do the deal for these ads, he is shaven. And that's very impressive, because if you've seen the film is a huge, hairy guy and youd think no one can shave that. But only these razors can, and they did it. Normally, shaving is a pain. It's uncomfortable, a razor burn, there's Nix, and it's that's expensive, but now it feels good, and it's cheap because of these guys. It's half the price of other big brand blades and the ship for Freedia doorstep, and they're better they're made in Germany and it's fun and the and so eso Harry from in the Hendersons is there. He's a big guy, kind of a weird guy, but he's a shaved guy now and he can go to the store. And he conveyed by whatever basically everything except razor blades. And you're paying $32 for an eight pack wolves. Not that much. It's 16. It's half the price and you get better shave and, ah, the starter sets an amazing deal. For $15 you get the razor, the moisturizing shave, cream, three razor blades and use the promo code handbook. That's five nose off that that's 10 total or something. I mean, honestly, youd have to talk to Harry himself about the details were just hard. He's got a weird voice thing. Cut were like, you know, but Eh uh, it's shipped to your door in the quality of the shaving, the look in the field of products all great. So go to Harrys dot com now, and Harry from Harry and the Hendersons will give you $5 off if you type in the Coupon code handbook with your first persists first person first purchase now I'm talking like him. Your first purchase, that's Harrys dot com and enter coupon code handbook. Could check out for $5.

But he''s usually not doing that s so then does that make him away? I think Sam, I would say, is normally a whack. But when we help him hey, could be looking like when we sort of fix his posture a little bit and have him, you know, kind of squeezes frontal to repeat us together because remember, save the marrow. Yeah, I remember safe Harrys plank. Sure about that. The dude destroyed his voice. He fucked up his throat or whatever. Who? The girl From it had a lady singer away. Ah. Okay. What''s the band? I'm thinking Off Veruca Salt saves the day or something. So that was snacker whack, right? Are we doing another? Do you guys want? I mean, do you like that? Because it is the thing you kind of brought me in to help you out with segments. Yeah, you're paying me an exorbitant really didn't. And so I just want to say, do you want any notes on what we just did? Or do you just Do you feel comfortable with how that went about? You won't tell us why it was good. Well, okay. Here''s what was good about it. Yeah. Is that gonna name it? Felt The okay. The name is good. It''s the name of one of our segments. I would say it''s maybe a little bit confusing because it''s such a long road From snacker wack in terms of a snack that we review on Doughboys is like, Oh, this is this is a food stuff so you can come very easily see the connection whereas snack calling a person of snack if they're attractive or calling them whack if they're unattractive, it seems you think it only works with chicks. Well, well, here''s Here''s the Here''s where was going. Okay, here''s what I'm hearing me on two friends. I'm hearing that when we use a sort of urban Pat wa and someone is looking like it back, Nick is saying that''s not anguish. If you're gonna live in this country, you have tow speak the king''s English, The From addiction area that took away. If you're gonna describe so one is looking like a stack, it has got a chick. I think I just that''s interesting. I just want to clarify. I think I think it''s going to my bigger is'sues that it seems mean spirited to judge someone on their appearance alone and then to make them like to order them to contort their body in a specific way. Like I feel like what you did to Sam was a little demeaning was against you looking like a chicken, like having him look a little more like a like a sexy stack is demeaning because it makes him look more feminine. I think I'm actually only have to conform to traditional gender roles and just have there have a chest look a certain way all the time. How a man should look that thing that''s starting to seem bad to me, Nick. I don't think you want to be out in front of this opinion, So to summarize what Nick''s saying, I just feel like because Sam, real men in a position where you guys air got a higher status than him. He might feel compelled Audio. Got it, cause I don't even see all that. I think about that way that oh my God, and work properly in a workplace equals who Both, you know, okay, have a role to play in the podcast, right?
