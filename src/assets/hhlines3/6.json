Okay, You're wondering Hey, Sean didn't Earwolf send you, like, really expensive nice sound equipment so that you would have good sound quality when you recorder episode's and ads from home. Yeah, actually, they did. But the product I am about to tell you about is actually located on my phone, and I use it so much, it''s got me addicted to my phone so that I can't put it down. So yeah, I'm recording this one from my phone so that I can click out of the ad, which I don't even really want to do because I'd rather be using the app. I can go straight back to the app and the app is called Fit bod fit bod. Sean, that sounds like you. Yeah, I know. If you've gone to the gym without a plan. You know how overwhelming the weight room can feel. I certainly have been lost, confused and often will spend two or three hours in the gym and leave without having done a single workout, because I just kind of went and looked at the machines and couldn't make heads or tails of the pictures they had on them. Fit Body is a smart fitnes's app that takes the gues'swork out of planning your workouts, their algorithm factors in your goals, experience level equipment, workout duration and muscle recovery to craft the perfect total body workout program just for you. Now this is true. I actually have used the APP, and if you do not want a total body workout program, if what you want is to focus on a single muscle, specifically, the muscle that connects from it''s like next to like the bottom of the six pack, and it goes in sort of points down towards like day. Weve talked about this muscle before. Um, anyway, you can select that it''s they have little photos of muscle groups, and you can point on that one and say, Give me this with each workout. The Apple earned your abilities and plans workouts designed to maximize your result's. It''s perfect for anyone who''s looking to get better fitnes's result's with your goal. The general fitnes's, strength training, muscle tone, bodybuilding, powerlifting or, in my case, Olympic weightlifting. If you have equipment, great. If you don't know equipment, theyve got body weight routines. This is something I want to say about the app, something I do like about it. I have pretty limited equipment. What I have is to paint cans. Well, really three, but one I want. I don't want to touch cause it''s got other stuff on it. But I have to paint cans and I do have a um it''s like a bike tire, but it has wings if that makes sense and those I havent seen them featured on the Apple. Any pictures? But sometimes I will pretend that the pain can is like a dumb bell and that the tire with wings as like a resi'stance band of some kind and when they do suggest, uh, work out to me that I can't do with my current materials. You can hit, replace exercise and scroll through, and itll give you something that you can do with what you have, be it paint cans.

That doesn't matter, is that it''s Ah, it is the brush that is making them smell so nice and is making Yogi Bear ah, float around on the smell behind me. I'm currently in my car. Ah, and his nose is kind of like bumping against the back of the car as he sort of follows the smell. It is very dangerous driving because he sort of floats right behind the car at this. Be the cars going in like switching lanes. Um, can be very dangerous, unles's you have, like, a lot of, ah of clearance. Um, one interesting thing I did some searching around and it doesn't look like Yogi Bear ever Did the floating on the smell in a cartoon. Ah, Bugs Bunny Did. I think Mickey Mouse did it a few times. But Yogi Bear never Did, uh, follow the smell of a picnic basket or of a pie on a window. Sell. Um, he just desired the basket and the pie and a grounded way. So this is, I gues's, kind of a new thing for him. It''s not something that future Quip user's have to worry about because he he does seem very attached THOMAS the smell of my teeth. Ah, and he''s and I don't think he''s going to be following anyone else''s teeth anytime soon. And of course, there is only one of him. Ah, and actually, more recent developed Ah, development is, um uh oh. Off the from frozen. The frozen Ah snowman has has joined him, and he is sort of floating behind us as well. Ah, and I asked him sort of what was going on there. Not something I as'sociate with him at all floating on the smells. Ah, but he, I gues's, is obse'ssed with anything that is icy and fresh. Ah, which definitely is totally fair. Um that does describe my teeth, since I started using the Quip. Ah, and which it also has a multi use cover that mounts, premieres and amounts to slide over the bristle's. I makes holiday travels clean and easy and has sensitive sonic vibrations is gentle enough for sensitive gums on Better get the built in timer pose's to remind you when to switch sides.

Hayes is right, because flight of flies is not like a thing that people say. Oh, so, like, that''s just the thing you just said just now. And so I got the note. So I'm just I'm just saying site of It''s a food podcast side. Yeah. No, you stand it out. No, he's right. That''s fine. Okay. We don't need to go. All right, OK, yeah, I got it. But anyway, we did that. We did that very early on the podcast, and part of the reason we did that was because Doughboys one of the original aims were considering was site of guys. Wow. Yeah, I imagine how huge the show could have been. You so big. That right, you would call it side of guys instead of Doughboys because there''s a dough is rarely ah factor in any of the stuff that you're eating on the show. Well, yeah. I mean, I gues's if you include, like bread and tortillas, you know, and pizza dough and the like, Can I just say there''s and I say, Can I just say please? I said, Flight of flies. So for you to say it''s not a thing that people say, like by definition judge, you're saying it even tell me that So, like, that''s not right the way in which it''s fine. That hazes right? I'm happy for Hayes. It makes it seem like you're accusing him of lying of s of seeing the flyer right in which I really did see and he really was pretty huge, you know, uh, when they ve closed, it''s just to say next. I think he actually might be. Yeah. I mean, I just I just think when a V club writes up the recap of this episode, they might they might be asking when Sean was riled up. Was that a shoot or was that a work? Now, see, this would be huge because I don't know what that means, but what would be really big for us is if we did get written up in that and we can just basically do it for them, not about me, but like, you know, at some during this, like, say, like, this is what you can say about that part of the show because there is some some reason that they're not doing it. And I wonder if it''s because we arent writing it for them as well, right? We're making them come up with everything. But I think he really was living with my because I came in here today like he wasn't mentioning it at, like you know anything about. It''s only now that he''s he''s come up with that. Well, maybe it was buzzing around this subconsciou'sly give him the benefit the doubt. Maybe we just was sort of just thinking about it. And then it came out of his mouth. When you put a microphone, you know, you put a microphone in front of somebody, you know what comes out. The truth is that there''s a flying his brain, The open, it's wings. No, I mean, I don't mean like a literally like a fly flew into his ear and worked it's way into his What happens inside of guys? Okay, so here was the thing of sight of guys. It was just we had We got a bunch of fast food sides from the same restaurant and then decided to rank them. And the thing was, it was just like that sounds fine. That sounds lateral. With all our other segments, I was incredible. OK, well, here''s the thing. It was just kind of It actually becomes a little abstract when you're weighing like onion rings versu's I think we did Taco Bell. And we did like a site of beans versu's, like, a site of there. And some might say that that is what the rest of the show is. Yeah, as well. Sure. You're basically saying Here''s the show where we take a little break from the where we either normal in the restaurant and we talk about whether it''s good now is a little bonus segment. Well hear the food for the restaurant. Talk about whether it''s good. That might actually be the correct diagnosi's for it and also the is'sue of if you get fast food from a restaurant and then we eat it on the podcast. As you guys know, From as two times veterans of the Pod, we try to go in advance because then we can digest The Beale and discu'ss it. And then if you try to get in the studio on the air, you get them chomping sounds. Yeah, and then you've also got was incredible but weirdly have having eaten with meds, huh? It''s oh, it''s as disturbing in the other direction. From how silent did this, right? It''s like it''s falling down his throat. He''s internalizing it. I mean, that''s the thing. It''s like, you know that your mind of is, yeah, you just always thinking always by the eating is so quiet. Yeah, his eating is very is stealthy. Oh, I think I found a picture of the fly.
