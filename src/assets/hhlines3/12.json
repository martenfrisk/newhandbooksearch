But you're actually not great at it yet because a lot of it you're still just so surprised of like what All the pieces is, you know, So don't do that. All right. You can only ever point the camera one thing at a time. Uh, okay, Number one, get two cameras. Number two heard of a GoPro. You can actually see the whole ocean with it. So and just strap it to something. So number three, you're praying roulette with someone else. Money. If you're gonna bet it all on black, you need to be able to explain why. So this is about diversity and film, Obviously, Um, I know it's a problem. You know, it's a problem. Violet Davis knows a problem she talked about in speech. So I would say that I don't understand why Sam Mendez is saying everyone like, if you put black people in your movie, you have to have a really good reason for me. The good reason would just be they should be in movies, too. And I know that's not popular to say, And I know certainly Hayes wouldn't want them in their um but I think those guys air great and even Chinese guys and ah, Spanish guys to could all do in the movies. And they should all get paid the same as how much money they make back. So that to me and also about, like, wage inequality in general. The reason that some kinds of people are getting paid less than other kinds of people is that certain kinds of people probably don't do all their own stunts like Tom Cruise does now and and take that. Hes you wouldn't you would have tried to stop me from saying that. Number four making action sequences only interesting When you're in the cutting room up until then, it is literally the most tedious thing you will ever dio. So that's his tip to you as a director. So I guess he's saying, Don't make action sequences is But I actually think there are a lot of times are the best part of movies, especially if it's an action based movie like James Bond. The guy who made James Bond is saying, Don't do any action sequences. I'm sorry. I call B s. Oh, wait, I can actually say it now. Bull spit. Okay, Number five on the day be prepared, but also be prepared to make shit up.","id":"AhIvMHMByMrymAEmvHWH","index":"handbook","podcast":"Hollywood Handbook","episode":"The We Don't Need Hayes Show with Jeff Dunham","speaker":"spk_0","timeCode":360.08,"tags":["Star Wars","James Bond","Sam","Mendez","Sam Mendez","GoPro","Violet Davis","Sam Mendez","Hayes","Tom Cruise","James Bond","James Bond"]},{"line":"That's fun.

And and so he's saying, Look, you're the boss, you're the director. If you are feeling sort of saucy and you got the juices flowing downstairs, don't be afraid to let people know. Hey, this is what I'm working with. And ah, right now, Since you all work for me, you should have to look at it and singing the bond theme. I assume that's a joke. It's probably You can sing anything you want. Um, and that's something we're gonna be doing on this show. Now is I can play more of the kind of music that I like. Hayes does it really always, like, have you know, the best taste in music?

Actually, I think the previous round you know was the rial finals I had actually does make me a married. Do you think sports briefly came up? Oh, good. Which is that because the head writer kind of kept me separated from all the writers. Weird gamesman'ship there. But Hayes was a really big basketball fan. I'm a big basketball fan. And he talked about how we would talk about basketball. And it helped us develop this little friendship despite the fact that the head writer was sort of aggres'sively positioning me against the writers, which again was one of the aspect's that I think led to a lot of Ah, you know, like the backstage drama and my physical and mental emotional deterioration. So basketball was like a very, very small entry point stuff that I keep referencing. We did the Big leg stuff. Yeah, yeah, right. And so, but so we then that really doesn't help.

Well, you know, im I mentioned a mention tee up top that he's it said shard could never do this. And I would say that thus far, maybe too much of a voice.

I'm hearing you so all right, Maybe I couldn't do exactly what he did. Just because, like you said, a lot of people can't find Big Lake. I know there was like, Ah, Lee, Harvey Oz world was like an amusement park with that show episode that Hayes wrote. That was the episode Hayes Room. Great joke at the end. Great visual that he and I talked about that that came up on the show it did at. Yeah, well, I couldn't do exactly what he could do. Ah, but, you know, you're doing a podcast of me. Here''s what you're gonna get fun. Talk about movies. A really original observation about sports. Um, politics. I mean, do you want to dig in? It?

Half my day rate half his day rate, and that's a lot of dough for him. So with Five Four Group and there''s exclusivity and the only way to get the brand is to be a member. Cody, can you think of a way to get the brand without being a member? Flip a coin. If it''s heads, do it. Okay, so all right, so I don't think he heard my question. You can't find five for anywhere else. You want to stand out in the crowd, not blend in like everyone else. Cody, what has some of the benefits of standing out in a crowd being identified by the police? That''s right. So you know it''s great, because if you get falsely accused of a crime like has happened to Cody a few times. It''s much easier to clear your name when people can really identify you easily. And with Five Four Group loathing, youll get off the hook. Trust the proven style authors who are leading the way, and they're gonna provide styling, advice and recommendations. Let them handle making you look good and educate you as to how to wear certain pieces. Cody. What''s the most confusing piece of clothing you've ever had to learn how to wear? Ah, hat in the to pay. Yeah, that''s right, because you want to get the ratio just right where you've got a little bit the to pay peeking out of the hat so people don't think you got a chrome dome under there. But you want the hat balanced in such a way where it''s not gonna freakin send that thing sliding down to the floor. So anyway, there''s convenience. You don't have time to shop. Your clothes come to your door every month. If you don't like to shop well, good, then use this instead. It''s an easy sign up proces's. You go in personal lifestyle preferences.
