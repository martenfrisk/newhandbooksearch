Turn your great idea into a reality with Squarespace, they make it easier than ever to launch your pas'sion project whether you're showcasing your work or selling products of any kind. Obviously, over the last few weeks I've talked about some, uh, not is'sues, but just like experiences that Sean has been having with Squarespace just to quickly recap Ah, he created a site called The Peaceful Post, which was a blank sort of. Can this where people could draw and post ideas about, like, how we could be peaceful with each other. And it would just be a place for everyone on the Internet to share their ideas in drawings. Ah, and somebody wrote the due to man on the page. So it's really just like a white space with someone writing the due to man on it. Ah, and Sean freaked out. And when to find out who it was, he did discover it was the backpack kid. He tried to arrest the backpack kid, but he was doing the flos's dance too quickly. So Sean decided he had to become the backpack kid. He Did posted a YouTube video of him doing the flaw stance, but he was doing it really, really fast and kind of like hitting himself in the but a lot of the time, as his hands were like pas'sing by in the back. Ah, and looked like hurting himself a lot and like causing himself bad, like medical injury. Ah. And so YouTube Did take it down as part of their policy against violence. Ah, and murder. And so Sean s. Oh, that actually takes us to the present day, which is that Shawn is working on starting his own video. Say, obviously, who better to partner for this than Squarespace? Um, there have been a couple false starts on the domain front for him. He tried to buy Squarespace dot com slash youtube, but that is apparently not how it works. Not ah, wow, That''s their site. Still basically, um, Then he tried to do a thing where he would get you tub. Not even you tub dot com. I think just you tub. But he would write a program where when you typed that in, like pos'sibly on your way to type YouTube, it would. The program would automatically go to his different site. So It would basically create a trapdoor in the U. R L Field on the way to YouTube and effectively disable all of YouTube''s power. And no one would really even be able to reach it anymore because of this trapdoor. Ah, the browser software companies have not been flexible on that. They won't let him write this program for the browser software. Um, and he did go around each of them personally and brought fluid what he described as fresh food toe have meetings with them. Ah, but they still were not interested in this concept or or the meeting s. Oh, now the work begins. I'm told on building a browser that will allow him to do the trapdoor or pos'sibly even have a very small U. R L bar that has a six character limit. So YouTube would not even actually be allowed in the U. R L Bar. Also, he has not yet been able to erase where it says the do do man on the peaceful post. So do not go to the peaceful post right now. Ah, wait until under. Like in the new browser, he feels like hell be ableto have that flexibility. So just wait until the new browser is finished and then you will be able to go to Utah and you will be able to see the peaceful post.

Is it too late to make our brand that we like Hamilton is anyone else tried to do that? I mean, I think people I've seen that attempted I've seen what happens first. You know the guy first. Do you know Hamilton first Or do you like it first and then he knows you. Does a guy find out you like it somehow? I think that''s I think that''s probably what it is like. He sees his fans and engages with them. OK, it''s one or the other thing about Lin Manuel Miranda, Not him again. Hamilton references Alexander Hamilton The historical figure. Okay, It''s not like there isn't like a modern guy. Didn't know. But I just Asian once you guys again and he''s looking for notes on the segments. Or do you just want to like, Do you like that one? What I think about my voice, I mean, look, I like you. I liked it because I'm thinking it''s, as you say, a shorter olden times. So I kind of did like a cool old guy s. I did where it kind of dragged. Yeah, that''s true. Um, want to tighten it up? I think it should be like 1/3 as long as it was I think a yeah. Maybe it could be shorter. Or maybe just rethink whether you or not, you want to do a segment specific toe, Hamilton, which is I get and I'm get. I'm not gonna. And I turned accused enough Sam''s that may be cut out some of that annoying sound he was playing. Yeah, again, I think. And I havent seen it, but I believe Sam was actually playing some of the musical Hamilton you're playing from the original cast recording. Okay, so that was Hamilton. And meanwhile, what you guys were doing, it sounded like Hayes was singing of from the soundtrack to Nightmare before Christma's. This is Halloween. Replacing Halloween with this is Hamilton. That was what? Yeah, that''s what that is. So if you don't like that, you probably don't like Hamilton. Do we know? Do we know him now? Is it pos'sible that now we are friends? That''s what I'm worried about. Gonna hear me wondering because usually when I come into this stuff on social media, all the people who like it are already friends with them. Yes, that is what''s confusing. He''s being like this. So now I wonder if we have cros'sed that bridge and now we're friends of Yeah, they're going like, Hey, I'm here to see it. Can I get in or something? But like he''s and here''s me and him afterwards. Is there a picture it''s like with him and share the show? That''s interesting. Does that exist now? I mean, if you havent taken it, and I don't remember taking it. But how is it pos'sible that all these other people did? Yeah, and not me. It was like like some of these people looking like this guy. What? Like not me? That seems impos'sible. So I have another segment idea, Okay, that we might want to sort of sort through. Right. And this is It''s basically and I don't know, exact. But you know how I talked about going down these Wikipedia rabbit holes before? Do you remember that one of you? What? I remember. What if you what If you're going down and you read the Wikipedia of, like, some of the most twisted, like, fucked up shit that''s ever happened? Like frickin Maryland Manson freakin What are the freakin bad guys? And then you sort of half remember what you read in Wikipedia and you talk about it with your friend way. Don't read it during way. Have read the article A long time ago. We read a day before. Yeah, some freaky stuff like cousin it. It sounds like you're talking about some sort of true crime. You're can do a true crime thing. But what You've referenced Marilyn Manson and cousin it. Marilyn Manson is a musician cousin. It is a member of the Adams family, so I mean I mean, I gues's I gues's you could talk about these things that are, like horror and pop culture. Or maybe that''s the thing. You could be a beast from Beauty and the beast, huh? You mean the beast from Beauty and the Beast is that we're referencing Kelsey. Kelsey Grammer is role in X Men three where he played the beast. I mean, beast. I mean, I'm reading that, and then I'm going like, he's do You even remember like that? He had to spend 2.5 hours in make up every morning, and that was before they applied The for and he''s going like, Oh, shit. Imagine that happened.

And my understanding is you spent an additional 2 to 3 years designing some of these other monster's that they maybe hang out with wild, wild things on s before somebody Did explain the end of the book to you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're just never really I had read at night. And I'm not a fast reader. And I get frustrated. Yeah. So I had read most of that book and didn't get to the end, but because I was so inspired to just kind of build out the world and yeah, that was about 2.5 years of just kind of what else is in the wild thing world. And what about that sea monster we never hear from him And just kind of digging deep into it and then, yeah, THOMAS later learn it was a dream. None of it's riel. You wasted your time? Yeah. Pis'sed me off it. Pis's me the fuck on getting pis'sed new heart all over again. And I'll tell you what else it up. Tell you what else? Yeah, that has given Bosch. And okay, yes. So now Bosch Random. He''s going to just write a book. Okay. A Children''s book. I mean, I'd be interested to read a dog''s attempt at writing a Children''s book. What does a dog think that Children are interested in? He''s well, hed like to be the star of it. Okay. He actually has an idea for his own cookbook for kids, but it''s really just an instruction manual on how to drop food on the floor guy. And that is sort of his concept. And to me, it feels sneaky.

And it feels like there could be some money in it.","id":"cBFqJnMByMrymAEmLI4o","index":"handbook","podcast":"Hollywood Handbook","episode":"Andy Daly, Our Cookbook Friend","speaker":"spk_1","timeCode":4122.29,"tags":["Bla'st","Sky","Bla'st","fir'st","Maurice Sendak","ju'st","Pi's'sed","Pi's","pi's'sed","Bo'sch","Bo'sch"]},{"line":"even it does.

I'm Sean Clements IV telling you about this show on this streaming platform. Tune in to see if Diane Lockhart will lead the resi'stance in a new post factual world with lawyers with the best stories triumph over the lawyers with the best facts. Sound familiar? Now, in honor of the CBS all acces's show The Good Fight, I am going to tell you guys about one good fight I have had with my co host, Hayes, who''s not here every time I read an ad for them. So, uh, one fight that we had was when we were in Chicago, we were on our way running a little bit late, actually, to get to the theater for sound check to do or show at that onion festival, and we were walking. And we're walking by this coffee place that had a specific kind of coffee that I like and we had already called Ah, car service. Teoh, come pick us up one of the big APs And he's had done it on his phone and I said, uh, sorry. Do I have time to just stop in for coffee real quick? And he in a tone that I did not like, went No, you don't. And I was like, Hey, f you, you know, because I just didn't like he sort of scoffed. And then, um, I got in the car with him and we went all the way to the theater. And then I walked out to get a coffee right next to the theater, and I really didn't like it wasn't very good. And I knew that I could have had that other one. We were about to do these two shows in front of a big group of people that I was pretty nervous about. And little things like having the coffee I want make me feel more comfortable before something like that. And so I was mad at him and being snippy and I was on, like, Day eight of, like, a 10 day course of prednisone, which, um, was to treat acute fair in J tous also something that, you know, I was like, I have to talk to all these people in my throat is mes'sed up, but it was making me not sleep well. I was irritable and and sweaty, and, um, anyway, that''s a really good fight that we had where I was like, if you don't say that to me that we don't have enough time and he said, Well, I call the car The car was gonna leave in two minutes. We were running late to the feet already, and I said, But I didn't get the coffee I wanted and he said he didn't realize that was so important to me. Anyway. It''s all fine now, and that''s a good fight. But there''s even better ones on the show. The Good Fight on CBS All Acces's Christine Baranski is back as the venerable Diane Lockhart, along with Cush, Jumbo Rose, Leslie, Sarah Steele and Audra McDonald. Delroy Lindo delivers another can't mis's performance while actor Michael Sheen shakes up the screen is infamous lawyer Roland Bluhm. New characters New ripped off the headlines. Storylines. New um ah dynamic cast? Well, no, I mean, not all of them are new. Some of them, you know, and you like already dynamic, casted so much more this season, the standard playbook goes out the window. So if you're tuning and for the standard playbook, it''s there. But it''s not being treated that nicely because it''s going out the window. Talk about how stacked the cast is, it says. Well, how about Christine Baranski, Cush, Jumbo Rose, Leslie, Sarah Steele, Audra McDonald and Delroy Lindo delivering another can't mis's performance, with actor Michael Sheen shaking up the screen anyway.
