And a lot of times people want to talk about what theyve done in the past three years, this year, the year before the year before that. But I just go like, Well, why are we doing that right? We got to do some of these recaps for us. Some of the right. And I mean, sometimes when you talk about new stuff, it, like, makes you feel like the stuff you've done in the last three years has resonated, you know, in a way. So it''s not going to go back.

And a lot of them are struggling with their relationship with their father, and they kind of got something to prove. Yeah, you know, it''s I mean, and I would be involved with casting. I feel like if you misca'st something like this, it just feels like a lot of actors playing rollers that don't like each other. And we want people to know that these rollers do love each other. Why?

Say, hey, shook up a guys chef kevin here. So Chef, Kevin is gonna tell you. So what they're saying what Squarespace is saying. Okay, so products and services, just a few clicks customize everything From looking field to settings and products using beautiful templates created by world clas's designer's.

And the new thing I'm doing is even better and even mawr great. And I think, uh will help more people, probably than Squarespace The Don't you agree, Kevin? 100%. So my new website is called Earwolf dot com, and it''s so, so cool, and you can go in there and build your own website on their way easier than Squarespace because what you have to do with Squarespace is have an idea. Pick out what it looks like. Put all your stuff on, but mine is better because you can build this website where your listening, you know, Ah, quitter in the garbage or you're listening to violin. Garland right and I've sort of, you know, uh, done some of the leg work for you where there''s a template there. Ah, that will have a picture of the guest's on the episode.

Yeah, you know, plugging away the fun thing about Earwolf dot com is, you know, Sean did 99% of the lake work on it. Uh, but I left a little room for you to kind of play. Ah, I like to think of it as, um Earwolf dot com Is this Ah, fun sandbox that I built And I put a lot of the toy trucks in and everything.

Sean has for Halloween constructed sort of a parity haunted house in this some underground parking structure called Disea'se Neiland. That's like a twisted, scary version of Disneyland. But he says it, like isn't even a scary is the rial Disney Corporation and some of the stuff they do. But, um, he''s got rides like these parody rides. He''s got something called the Tower of Terrorism, which is an office chair that you sit on, and somebody dres'sed up like Buzz Lightyear, wearing a turban and, like covered in oil, makes the chair like posed the lever and make the chair descend quickly. They kind of like surprise's you. I did previews things past weekend, so, um, I did the right. He''s got a parody of the Indiana Jones ride called Indian a free state of Jones because he saw Free State of Jones last weekend. He was really into it. So it''s somebody. It''s Sean dres'ses free save jobs, and he''s like freeing a bunch of women from a car. It''s not really a ride, I gues's.

Here''s songs with Open Mike Eagle, Ted Leo, Paul F. Tompkins, Janet Varney and more. In other news, apparently I have changed my name to and Mawr Yeah, well, so Hayes''s upset a little bit. No, no, no. Please refer to me by my new name. Oh, and Mawr. So my co host and more is a little upset that they didn't initially wanna keep him in the list of people to promote the show. Uh, even though he did do an episode of the show. Ah, the way he did the episode was Tani told Josh The producer what comedians she wanted to work with. Josh reached out to those comedians. Hayes was one of them. Excuse may please refer to buy new stage name. I forgot. My name is and mores backdoor his way into the list. So, um, so now and more got contacted by Josh because Tony had requested him. Um, And then, uh, and Mawr did this episode where they did a song, and it''s like it says, you know, here the podcast is funny, but the songs are legit. I, of course, wouldn't know I was not on the list of comedians that Tony wanted to work with. I was not one of the people that Josh reached out to. Didn't even know about this show until my friend and more told me that he was doing it. So I get him not being happy to not be included in the list 12 hours out of my week to do the show.

His name is and more now and not may you? Josh''s respon'se was Hey, that''s just what Tawney wanted. I mean, she told me who she wanted to work with. Don't say that.

Hey, how come he asked my co host, who I'm inseparable from it within this network. Ah, and not me. Thank you. Say this se. Oh, yeah. It was just an order thing.

Our fearles's leader here in Earwolf gave us a little bit of ah, directive where he said, Guys, you have to have an evergreen episode, you have to record one where there''s no specifics. You don't talk about anything political, any of the movies, any pop culture stuff now because we need tohave something in the chamber ready to be released. So we want to do this evergreen episode. It''s September 2016 now, but way want September 8th? Yes, but we want to really be able to release this. Hey, any time in case on the bad? Yes, something bad. You know, he's and I are on the same flights a lot. Stuff like that where he goes, like in case something happens where you guys either can't release an episode and we need time to prepare a statement about how, um your dad you're in a coma. Your don't exist anyway because it would have to be that because we will always like we do the show we love what ends too much We love our family will never not do the show. We did the show when it was raining your during the reign. Once we did the show, I was when I when I was snorkeling in the lake, remember? And I surfaced right where a duck had just pooped Yeah, and some of it got in his mask got in the way of the mask. And two days later, I did do the show. Yeah, he didn't barely talked about. We did the show when I had to, and I don't want to get too graphic. And again, we're not gonna use this part anyway. But when I had to go the bathroom and then I did go to bathroom, and it was difficult, The and it hurt. So we basically will do it under any services. So there''s no way that they're ever gonna release this one. And I want to apologize to you, Muecke, this great guest who we havent had before, and we probably arent ever gonna play this one. It could be a clas'sic episode, but people won't here. Yeah, well, yeah, a disa'ster would have to happen then. And we can't have you promote anything because it would be too connected to the time that it was really a lot. And don't try to, like, do something to her car or whatever.

When you shoot the center, his arms lift up his sweatshirt and they expose his nipples and then a bunch of ants, I think also mechanical.

It says It''s on like a plaque that the ants think that his nipples are red hearts for Arab hand red hot candy because they're so red and they're also very, very large. And so he''s being munched on by these ants, and he keeps saying he''s like, sort of half crying. But he''s also excited because he keeps saying like, This is like, This is like Westworld.
