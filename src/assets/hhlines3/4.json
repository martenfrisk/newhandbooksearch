Even when I'm not feeling like I neces'sarily need more hydration, I just I think the taste is good. It has, of course, Made Sean very pis'sed off.

It''s like a big hobby of his is flying helicopters around. And he did chop up the cloud, the gas, ivy by accident. He got a little too close to it from wanting to be friends with, and he did end up chopping it up big time. So that''s an ongoing is'sue.
