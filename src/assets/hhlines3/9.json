And then the actual nudie street kernel of New York got mad and he tried to send the army to beat us up. And then we found out that the new street Colonel New York doesn't have that many friends in the army. And the army was actually doing that. We were the cool ones, and they don't like him s So we were talking to some of our new army friends the other day at the Army. Me and John went there on they offered to go punch a new streak around New York for us on, and we were like No, like that's all over with. It is just about that, like this is all over a T shirt company, even though the T shirts are really good and you get one every month for only 30 bucks, even though they normally cost 100 bucks in the store. And they have different kinds, like Henley''s and be next inside the teachers. They're good, but we don't want anyone to be punched over it. But the Army members, the guys who participate in the Army, were sort of riled up at that point, and one of them did go up to the new street Colonel New York and not punch him, but kind of motion his face like put his whole hand on his face and mush it backwards. And the news reader of New York fell back right in front of a tank that was exploding, and the the tank blew a hole in his hair like right through his hair. And it''s very hard to explain, but he had. This still has this very kind of high hair. It''s not like a beehive, but it, like, kind of piles up in this very unusual way.

Ah, we thought it would be kind of funny if we combined most two words and make our own car service called Luber. Now, whys it, Lou brother, than just combining the names? Well, the back seats of all the cars we, uh, have is hard to get into, so you kind of have to grease up or just be smooth somehow because we really only have the one car. It's one of those ones with, like, three wheels that looks kind of stupid and cool at the same time. And what happened is I had left the door open pulling out of a gas station and it dented the hinge it There's only a door on one side. It dented the henge in so it doesn't open all the way. So if you're nice and lubed up, you can get into the Luber, which me and hes did that morning. Anyway, Brutus pulls the Luber over and hes sort of shimmies himself out.

I was seeing that I was kind of flipping ahead to some of the other.

I just don't think people will understand. I think people will need. But it sounds like there's a plan in place to have people reading along with the script as they're watching this movie is that would help, yes, and they very much help. Ideally, theyve read the old draft before they start watching it, too. And then they're reading the current draft while they watch it. You're not allowed into the movie unless you've read. It's a whole dress, fully interactive experience. And that, I think, is the future of film this. You never said film this way before. That's a Scotsman thing, to call it a feel. Well, you know, I've created my own term. I've created a lot of my own terms, and film is one of You know what? I used to love hearing these. You talk for hours about the difference between film and film and what it meant, but I can't stomach it anymore. And where I orbed it did. Well be filming it on film. We're not shooting this digital because we can tell the difference. And we need the grain. Digital looks about as good as it. I mean, it's just a production thing. It's ask you what? Oh, sorry, but come on. You know, that's bs. Now, uh, I just remembered because, man, I, um, have the cash that you wanted. Oh, wait, Whats this for? He really He really needs its just because? No, because he just got jumped by some of the beach cops. And so he had had a bunch of cash that he was He was bringing you got jumped by beach. Told me that same story, Shawn.

How much money is in that envelope? $225,000. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, those beach guys, he's gonna have much money if he's gonna get me back. He's good for it because he's actually gonna He knows where the beach cops keep their stash. Just think about this story that he's telling you. He's telling you that a bunch of beach cups, a bunch of officers of the law jumped him and took over 200 grand that he was carrying on his person. Yeah, well, it was, for he was gonna pay rent on his bus location. No, but think about that like that. There's no way that that's that much money. I mean, what? How much? First of all, he's parks on the street. There's no rent rest and whats head in the sand are you rolled the bus in the sand. Now you put the bus on the symbol notices and or in the street. So the beach cops are probably responding to that. No, man, they're just So you're saying you do believe the beach cop story?
