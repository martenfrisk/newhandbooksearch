Induccino, I actually had a funny story related to to them recently. Sean, has been asking my friend Sean has been asking what I want for my birthday. Because he's like, your birthday is coming up, like, what do you want? My birthday is not coming up. It's, like, not around now, but Sean celebrates my birthday on September thirtieth so he can do kind of a mash up parody song that hero called happy birthday when September ends. So he's, like, been getting excited to, like, do the song, and he's, like and then he comes up to me and he's, like, don't even tell me what you want. I have two great presents for you, and it combines your two favorite things, looking good and feeling good. And I was like, wow. Like, this is so exciting. I can't wait to see what Sean got. And he comes to my house, and he's very sad. And he's, like, he's, like, kicking little rocks. And his head is hanging, and he looks really sad and bashful. And I said, what is wrong? What happened? And he said, so something went wrong with the gift. It is the two things, but I I got mixed up in, like, how I gave them directions for how to do it. And so he he pulls out, and then he pulls out and he shows me a best of Mike Myers's that's on SNL tape, v h s tape, and it is dressed in a custom fitted indochino suit for itself. And I immediately realized what happened. I totally understand how things got a little bit crossed up. The tape looks so good. Like, just looking at it, like, I have it kind of standing up. Next to my TV, it looks bomb. Like, it fits so well. The suit is so nice. Because that's what you can do with Indochino, like, we have clothes from Indochino that we love. I have, like, not a suit, but, like, different pieces from it that I can match with all these different things. But now I think I might get a suit too because I can see how good it looks on the tape. Indochino is the world's largest made to measure men's wear brand, and they make suits, shirts, coats, and more made to your exact measurements for a great fit. I can see on the tape, like nothing is, like, hanging, everything is, like, sort of lined up perfectly and, like, hugging in the right places, loose in the right places. And you get to personalize all the details, your lapel, your lining, your own monogram, the tape does have at an initial monogram in the lining that says so the monogram is b o m m o s v t, which is best of Mike Myers on SNL v h s tape.
