Please just go through fast so the next person can can do it. This is a new a new earwool thing. I guess they had to sell a lot of their servers because the company is doing so well. That's what Colin told me I don't know. But now, Colin is using his phone as a wireless hub and that is the server. So only one listener at a time allowed. Anyway, stamps dot com. Anything you can do at the post office, you could do right from your desk with stamps dot com. Buy in print official US posted for any letter and package using your own computer and printer. Stamps dot com, never closes so you can get it whenever you need it twenty four seven. As I said, that, you know, different from our podcast and that our podcast is closed to all but one person at a time. The thing to do I think is to have parties get people together. I think that could be a really happy outcome of this is like a bunch of people get together and actually do something in person for once and not aren't always like using their phones. But that is bad for stamps dot com, the post office is bad, so don't go to the post office. We use stamps dot com. We send out letters and packages stamps dot com. We're using it actually. We're gonna be sending out in the future a time slot. Through a mail, you will get If you listen to the if you have ever listened to the show before you will get a letter with a date and time in it each week for the episode and that is your time window when we would like you to listen to the show.

No. It's the same one I was talking about before. That's how much I like it. Happy socks. Get happy baby with your socks. So they wanted me to clarify a little bit about what I said in my last ad regarding the really cool idea where you are going to be taking some of these socks and maybe they got a panda bear or French leader Sarkozy or something on it. And and you put those those socks over the plain white socks that the r h c p red hot chili peppers war on their special area when they do these big concerts. They want to say this joke to you, which is I hope when you put the happy socks on there doesn't make these guys too happy because then the socks could go flying all over the place flinging around if you know what I mean. And that's a joke they wanted me to say. Support for today's show comes from this great company, Happy Sox, and and they are the world's favorite choice for colorful socks and under wear and they have almost an endless variety of original designs but not quite endless and I like that. Enless is too big a concept for me. They offer high quality socks underwear for every occasion mindset and style and they're available in adult and children sizes. So if you are getting them for your children, please don't show them the naughty photoshops that I'm talking about doing. It's not appropriate and Also, the whole family can match and you're sure to find the perfect pair for anyone in your life and each unique design turns in every day essential into a colorful piece that's crafted with the highest standards in quality. So keep that in mind but again, San Hayes Davenport all your tweets of all your photoshops of the, you know, the the gang who brought us scar tissue and aeroplane and and and Also, if you wanna pretend to be Anthony Kiedis or Flee or whatever with your happy socks, send that directly to Hayes as well. Don't do it to me. I can't see my Twitter, so there's no point.
