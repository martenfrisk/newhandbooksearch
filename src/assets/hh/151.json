In my salad days, I would often sit and reflect on what had led me to the career I'd found. Was it my groundbreaking performance and you can count on me?

I think it was the latter and I'll tell you why. I sit now on my veranda sipping a tall glass of whiskey, and looking at the front of a newspaper where the top headline reads, Sean Clement had the idea for the voice for the teacher thing. That that did. The newspaper article is as true today as it was in nineteen seventy nine when it was reprinted on his thirtieth anniversary. What else?",
