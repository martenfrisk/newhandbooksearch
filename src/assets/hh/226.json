    "line": "Hi everybody. My name's Chris Gatherd, letting you know that this week, the 100th episode of Beautiful autonomous comes out. I wanna thank everybody who listens to this show where I I just talk to people on the phone. Never expected it to change my life the way it has. Thank you for supporting it. I thought this show was just gonna be like all comedy fans, print calling me messing with me. Instead, I've realized that I'm a citizen of a large world and that people have so much common no matter where they are, whether whether it's someone who's a heroin addict or someone who's thinking about buying a record store or someone who shits their pants all the time or someone who has a kid with cancer or or or someone who's a swinger or someone who really loves Donald Trump, someone who escaped from a cult, someone who made out with their teacher in high school. I was able to talk to all these people one hour at a time and realize at the end of the day, what this project has taught me is that we're all people and we're all living our lives and we're just trying to get by and just trying to find happiness in this messed up world that seems so goddamn confusing. Check out beautiful stories from anonymous people on Apple Podcast. Stitcher or your favorite podcast app. Thank you for listening.",
