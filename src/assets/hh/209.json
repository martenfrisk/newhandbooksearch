We've been doing it for over three hundred episodes we're celebrating by sitting down with a hip hop legend, my favorite m c, Wu tang clan founding member, method man. That's right for over hour. We talk about his music career, songs he's released. We talk about his television appearances from the wire to the brand new show, The Deuce. And also, the debut of Drop The Mike, which is a show that I created and co executive produce on TBS. It debuts October twenty fourth at ten thirty. It's where celebrities rap battle against each other, and I swear to you, it's better than that sounds. I promise you that. But listen, you could download our episode now at Apple Podcast or on the Eyewolf network, and listen to to an engaging conversation, sort of candid. A lot of stuff comes out with literally one of the best rappers in the game still method man. We hope you listen. And, yeah, whatever. Have a good time.",
