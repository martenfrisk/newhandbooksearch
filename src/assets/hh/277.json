Ballness can be optional. Thanks to four hymns dot com, and they are one good option that you have. They connect you with real doctors and medical grade solutions to treat hair loss, They're well known generic equivalents to name brand prescriptions to help you keep your hair. It's not snake oil or pills or gas station counter supplements. So this is one thing you could do. Now it's not gonna surprise anybody to hear that, yeah, there's other options. In particular, if you don't wanna go to four hymns dot com and answer a few quick questions and have a doctor review and prescribe you, no doctors at all involved in my thing, it's called for Mums, m u m s. So Mums is a pretty, like, kind of pom pom flower It comes in a bunch of different colors. And, basically, my idea is if you order mums for me at a pretty decent markup, you can put them on your head and it will look like you have cool crazy hair, almost like a muppet or some kind of anime character. So for him, you know, their products are shipped directly to your door. With moms, I just kinda tell you a garden where the moms are. And you can go and collect as many as you want. There's no more waiting rooms and no more awkward doctor visits in either one of them. So Order now, my listeners get a free trial month of hymns for just five dollars today right now while supplies last, could see the the website for full details. And then moms were between websites at present. But just keep dialing one eight hundred me want mums until you get an answer, and then that if when I can secure that number, that will be me, and I'll just go like I think I drove by some moms earlier today at a cemetery or whatever. So they it would cost hundreds if you went to the doctor or pharmacy for the stuff hims has, but instead you can go to four hims dot com slash The boys, that's f o r h I m s dot com slash t h e b o y s. For hims dot com slash the boys, but also do the moms thing.",
