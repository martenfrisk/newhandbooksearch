    "line": "do you ever hear something and wonder to yourself, hey, was that racist? The show Yo as this racist tries to answer that question. It's hosted by Andrew Tee and Toni Usom who you probably know all your favorite Dear Wolf shows. And in each episode, Tony and Andrew cover racism and recent news in pop culture with guests like Jimmy O' Yang, Nicole Bayer, Lab Burton and John Lovett. And this week, they're releasing their one thousandth episode. To celebrate, there's an extra long special episode with a ton of guests you don't wanna miss. So I walk into earwolf. This past weekend. And I see cupcakes everywhere. Boxes and boxes, two boxes of cupcakes. And I say what is this? What happened? And Tony is there. And she says, oh these are from Colin. It's for our one thousandth episode. Now they do five episodes a week. It's fine. They do an episode every day. It's fine. That's great. But that means that their one thousand episodes is the equivalent of our two hundred episodes. For Hollywood Handbook. And we this is Hayes by the way. And we did two hundred episodes over a year ago. So it has been over a year. And this is what happened when I went into the studio when we did our two hundred episode. Walk in And on the count the counter is barren. Except for one fortune cookie, that I pick it up. And I'm like, this is fine, nice. I don't need a a hole to do. Fortune cookie is fine. But I look at the fortune cookie, and a tiny little piece has been removed from the back. And the fortune itself has been extracted through the little hole in the fortune cookie by what appeared to be a sticky tongue.",

Blue Apron delivers fresh perfectly portioned ingredients that you can use to cook in credible restaurant quality meals in as little as twenty minutes right to your door. Just choose from a variety of step by step, chef design recipe options, all with insanely delicious flavors. Then get rid of your grocery list and let Blue Apron do the meal prep for you. Whether you're looking for a quick and easy meals or or full culinary cooking experience, Blue Apron has you covered. Still me just me. I am very happy with how this is going, how I'm doing. I do think I'm doing a good job. You will notice doing this ad normally chef Kevin would sort of appear and sort riff off of his takes on the theme menu for this month for for blue apron or some of the foods that they're doing this month, and you may be noticing that we don't have any foods mentioned in the ad this week. Buibrant is, of course, still doing foods. But one reason we are skipping them this week is there was a little misstep with Kevin's plan for the foods that that he wanted to do this week. He wanted to do scary Halloween blue apron. And, of course, Kevin's sort of signature food is spaghetti and he was going to prepare the spaghetti in a way that it was the witch's hair. And he of course, when you're Sending the Blue Apron food, they don't set they send ingredients. They don't send them all cooked already, of course. So that's a fun you do it yourself. And I love doing it. But the spaghetti was dried and it came with a a recipe of that he did called scary soup. But that was already hot. And there was an issue in the delivery process where there was a guy driving a truck and he's driving the scary soup and the witch's hair, the dried spaghetti, And some of the scary soup, which was very hot, did spill, and it did boil the spaghetti, which caused to very rapidly increase in size. And the cooked spaghetti busted through the wall of the truck into the cab where the driver was and the driver did drown in spaghetti. Although, that's allegedly what happened. It is unclear if he was going to drown already and if it didn't have anything to do with the spaghetti. So that is sort of the legal avenue that Kevin is exploring now, although he is currently in jail. So that's why there's no blue just that is just to explain why there's no specific blue apron foods, you can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals free at blue apron dot com slash handbook. That's blue apron dot com slash handbook to get your first three meals free. Blue apron, a better way to cook. Let's adapt the O' Farah Schmidt.",

Where Sean has been endeavoring to create these kind of alternative products that often sound a lot like him, like the company name but don't infringe on what the product is doing too directly.

And this time, he is starting with or he decided to start with the the product and that he needed basically to do a pill. And so what he did, he we there were conversations about me being the first person to kind of test it and he showed me the pill and he asked me to eat it. And the pill said different body parts on it. I think it was a piece of novelty dice. Where you go you can get it from a place like Spencer's gifts and one of the pill one of the dice says body parts like lips, or hair, and the other says, like, stuff you can do, like, the blow. And he had one of those and he said, you roll the dice and then whichever body part comes up, you eat it you eat the dice, the the one dice, and then you get a bigger version of that part and I did this and I did wake up in the hospital and Sean was unfortunately in jail.

Simple contacts lets you conveniently renew your contact lens prescription and reorder your contacts from anywhere in minutes. It's vision care for the twenty first century. The simple context vision test is self guided and it takes less than five minutes. It isn't a replacement for your periodic full eye health exam, but it'll save you so much time when you need to renew and reorder. I've done it. It's great. The contacts are great. I actually have some that I got sent, not in the normal box and kind of a cardboard box. But it says open for the simple contacts ads. So let me open that right now. Okay.
