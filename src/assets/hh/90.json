And this leads into one of my favorite montages of the teen pope walking around by himself just really thinking with a pillow in his mouth. With a pillow still in his mouth as a reminder of what scene just happened before. That's another writer's tip. Always have some element of the scene that just happened before whether it's a flashback from the past or to the future or from another country or different anything. Always have some elements. Okay? Mhmm. It can be another character from another scene who walks by in the background. They can be wearing the outfit of the person they're wear talking to in the previous scene, whatever. You have to connect the dots for the viewers. No offense to the audience, but you're stupid as shit. Okay? So you gotta do these things. Okay? So he's walking around and I wanted to say let's make it real time. Right? And when I think about something, it usually takes about two to three weeks to make a decision. K?
