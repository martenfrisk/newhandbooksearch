You know, you you know that the box is fully designed, you know that the free shipping is gonna end on December ninth, so you gotta act now. And you go to harrys dot com right now, and get a limited edition holiday set all supplies last. Don't forget to enter the code handbook at checkout for five dollars off. That's harrys dot com. Code handbook. It a man's feeling so good right now. You know what I think I'm gonna do? A single little tune about Harry's. Well, it's a limited edition shave set. It makes a great gift. If you haven't heard of them, Harry's was started by two best friend Jeff Finandi and I feel so good sunk doesn't have to run. Who were fed up for being overcharged for razors so they start their own razors company and give a great shave at a fair price. Yeah. Well anyway it's the midnight blue Chromers handle. What else is going on with the friggin add? Okay. Yeah. German engineer five blade cartridge, that's good. That's a plenty of blades. Close comfortable shave, foaming shave cream smells amazing, Let me think. That's probably it. So look for Santa Man everywhere on every poster, every billboard, every movie, because I'm back baby. I just had to ride out the little low point, the little sort of wave of things were going so good. Now I'm back. This is probably the last ad I'll do for Harry's because they can't afford me anymore.
