    "line": "hey, guys. I wanna talk to you about the now hear this podcast festival. It's happening in Anaheim from the twenty eighth to the thirtieth of October. There are gonna be a lot of podcasts there, spots, WTF, how did this get made? We are gonna be there. We're gonna be performing on Saturday, the twenty ninth, in Anaheim sorry. I'm I'm recording this after this week's show. Sean has gone if you've been listening to the show, you know, that Sean has an issue with Disneyland, where it's a few different things. He was once he went on space mountain and in the photo, his sweatshirt flew up over his head, and he wasn't wearing anything under it, and he has, like, sort of discolored nipples, and it was very popular selling photo. It's it's space mountain and it's still the most popular item at Disneyland. He also has a thing with goofy where he thinks the goofy thinks that he is funnier than Sean and has embarrassed Sean on several occasions. Comedically at Disneyland. So this is a thing with Ann you know, he doesn't wanna go to Annheim to do. The festival so right after we recorded this episode, Sean told me that he was going back to Disneyland to sort of conquer his fear, I guess. He didn't say it that way. But I think that's sort of what it's about to conquer his fear",

    "line": "So he went and it's first it's it's late September, so it's Halloween themed that. They're doing like their Halloween time thing. Which he thought was done just for him, like, just to scare him personally. But he texted me that he, like, wasn't scared, but it seemed like I'll just read I'll just read his text. So he gets to Disneyland and he he texts. At Disney Bland, that's what he's been calling it recently. Sucks not cool. That's the first text. And then he texts, they made it scary for me too bad I'm not scared. Then just got surprised by a jack o'lantern but not really. Then I see goofy. He's got vampire teeth and a cape, not funny. And so then I text him don't talk to goofy but he doesn't he doesn't really acknowledge the receipt that his phone receives text. I don't know if he knows that it has that functionality. I think he thinks it's just a sender, a tech sender. So then he writes going to go Van Helping on him. I think that's a I think it's supposed to be Van Helsing. I think that's an auto correct. So he writes that one and then five hours later, there's a text says, hey, I had to go to jail to check on something, can you come get me? So I guess something happened between him saying he was going Van Hellsing on goofy and this last thing. So I'm on my way to to get him now But come to our show. You get you go to now hear this fast dot com to get tickets. If you use the code handbook, you save twenty five percent on a three day pass. Now here at this fest dot com offer code handbook. It's in Anaheim on the twenty ninth of October.",
