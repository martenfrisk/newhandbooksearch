    "line": "It's me, well then. Here to catch you up on what's going on with me and my friend Mac. In case you don't recall last time we spoke, we had recently come to the realization that all along Mac and I were living in The present day two thousand nineteen and we thought we were living sometime in the eighteen hundreds. But it turns out all along we were just in a western themed water park that I think was maybe called gusher gulch but I'm honestly not too sure. And so we were thrust headlong into modern society and had to acquaint ourselves with all the new technologies and the modern ways of behavior. This was such a shock to Mac system that he did lie face down on the ground immediately upon leaving the the the water park I was taken to a facility. It was the facility same facility from the movie annihilation which I have since scene, and I was brought up to speed on everything that's going on in twenty nineteen. I'm really enjoying my new my new life in the modern world. I've acclimated myself very well. I've married a human rights attorney and I am learning to code. Mac, on the other hand, has returned to the park. He is pretending I will go and visit him sometime he is pretending that he never knew that he was living in modern times. He has gone he has returned to living underneath the deputy's dip, which is a a wave pool, sort of a wave pool float ride, lazy river wave pool. And yeah, I I do miss him. I do miss my friend. But I do I I also love my new wife. I would not leave her for any reason. And so it seems that Mac and I do have to go our separate ways for now. Hey, whatever you're wearing right now. Mac Weldon is better. Mac weldon is a premium Man's essentials brand that believes in smart design. Premium fabrics and simple shopping. Not only do Macwelden's underwear socks and shirts look good, they perform well too. They have a line of silver underwear in shirts that are naturally antimicrobial, which means they eliminate odor. If you don't like your first pair, you can keep it and they will still refund you. No questions asked. So for many months doing these advertisements, I never fully understood what we were doing or why, Now I understand that this is a clothing line that is advertised on podcasts. I basically there's not too much more that I have to learn. About this world we live in today. I'm a Twitch streamer as well. I I also love these clothes. I wear this sweatshirt, but they sent me and I love it so much, and I wear the undies as well. The website is so easy to use.
