He must be talking about something other than Hollywood no, there's still so much to do there. So it is a class that we are offering to guide some of these lost souls who want to create art but don't have the tools and maybe don't even have a store they could drive to to get the tools or even a school. We're the school now and the school is me. I'm the teacher, classes in session sound to bell. Schools in sucker and and you get to hear me work live with a student who's insanely talented, amazingly cool, funny, really smart, really nice guy. One of these guys just like Oh wow. Like is he fucking with me? He's being so nice because you just have those conversations with him where forty five minutes go by and you realize I've been talking about myself the whole time and I haven't asked about him and then you ask about him and he goes like fuck you man. So it's just like that kind of nice where there's an edge to there's a danger. You know, he's not the guy in the PG third teen movie that you're all really hoping's gonna make it. He's the guy in the r rated movie. He's a bad man. He's a bad bad man, swingers. He's bang, Raj man, and he's here on the show and bang, talk a little bit about the class and some of what you learned and and some of your experience without spoiling anything that would make it that people won't pay money for it. You gotta pay money for this podcast. Most podcasts are free. This one is of about the same quality maybe worse and this one cost money. So please do get involved with that.",
