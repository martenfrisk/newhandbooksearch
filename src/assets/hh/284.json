This is what I wanna talk about. I have decided to go a little wild, and I wanna give my listeners permission. What I was doing was you're gonna get four buzzes while you're doing your quip. So I was doing, like, top left quadrant, buzz thirty seconds later, top right quadrant buzz thirty seconds later. Bottom left. I was doing it like that. Now what I'm doing, do the whole fucking thing. I brush the whole mouth and then when it buzzes, do it again. And I don't care and I don't care that I'm not following the rules. It is more fun. Yeah. It's more fun because I was feeling like I was limiting myself, but sometimes I wanted to sneak over and get the other side or I wanna drop down and get the bottom. I go, I'm not allowed.
