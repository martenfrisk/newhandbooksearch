And lately, I've been fighting myself pretty sad without my friend, Mac. So sad that I decided to separate from my wife and spend the rest of my life electronically with my best friend, Mac. And so I return to Gizzer goats only to find that it was the off season and the gates were locked for the rest of the winter And so all that Mac that I can do is put our palms up to the plexiglass guard in the front gates. And talk to each other in words that we can't hear and cry and cry. Even while I'm holding a microphone and recording this podcast advertisement. Be wee wee wee wee wee wee a good outfit.

And if you are out there and you're like me and you're a young podcast listener and you go, am I supposed to be changing my sheets? Yeah. You are. You're supposed to. So get two set of my sheets rock. That's what I did. And now every day I walk around feeling like this, Devin. Yeah. It's pretty sweet to be me. Now that I got my sheets rock.
