    "line": "hey, guys. This is Hayes, one of the hosts of Hollywood Handbook. As you guys know, we have done this in collaboration with the Eer Wolf podcast network, which was recently acquired by the e w scripts company, the sort of traditional media broadcasting company, I'm excited about this. I don't really see a problem with it. They did have a couple notes on how we read our ads. Which Sean protested against. And so I will be doing the ads by myself. He is not happy with with me either, but with no ads, there's there's no show. And I don't think that's reason to call someone the mean principal from Matilda. And I don't think this request from scripts is unreasonable. They they don't like when people skip the ads. They want us to do something to make the ads more exciting. So that's all it is. You know, I'm just it's not it's barely gonna sound different. So let's just let's just get right into the ads. Today's episode was brought to you by Netflix presenting TIG, a documentary that follows the life of comedian, TIGnotera, The documentary chronicles her journey to find humor and a new perspective on life after dealing with a series of incredible tragedies. The film offers an inside look at the comedian's process of turning her worst fears and anxieties into pure comic gold. Now streaming only on Netflix. So that's it. That's that's that's all. And enjoy the show.",

Sean isn't doing the ads this week, but he did want me to ask you, please use gift up for sure, but just don't look at his gift tub. He had a little trouble with the the technology aspect. What happened was he he he accidentally called his mom and left a voice mail of himself singing a splish splash, like, the song, like, it was like splish splash. I was taking it back. But in kinda like a a cute, high pitched voice, And then it turned out he had made a gif of a hedgehog being washed in the sink with just the audio of him apologizing to his mom for missing her birthday. So you can see sort of what went wrong there. Please don't just out of respect for Sean, please do not watch his gift dub. It's very sad.
