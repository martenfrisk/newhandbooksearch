We we we I thought it would be a funny joke, but I got arrested and thrown in jail. They're torturing me. Anyways, the one saving grace was that even though they found the bomb, they also found Harry's razors. There was a convenient travel pack inside, and they just couldn't believe the quality durability of the blades. And the fair price, just two bucks a blade. Boy, a lot of these different soldiers and stuff that have been dragging me around and waterboarding me, etcetera. Have been commenting on how they wish they used Harry's to shave their face. It's a trial set that comes with everything you need a close comfortable shave, and you can get it yourself. And I told them that too. There's a weighted ergonomic handle for an easy grip. A five blade razor with a lubricating strip and trimmer blade for a close shave, rich lathering shave gel that will leave you smelling great. Ow wee wee wee wee wee ow. It hurts to do my trademark laugh. And there's a travel blade cover to keep your razor dry and easy on the go. Listeners of my show can redeem their trial set at harrys dot com slash handbook to redeem your offer and let them know I sent you. I sent you to help support the show. Yeah. It's I myself use them in love and they even noticed that the parts of my face that are beard are so smooth. They've been really complimentary as they're roughing me up. They've been threatening to maybe even kill me, but Santaman can't die. I would just get tortured forever. Use Harry's razors, everybody. We we we",

I saved fifteen friggin bucks buying it off friggin the web, and I am gonna fire this thing up and do PlayStation on it. So I'm putting in the disc. Okay. It's spinning and it says movie not found. That's probably the load. That's like the loading screen. Anyway, it was a great deal. It was cheap to do it and it's so it's now it's clicking at me. It's clicking really hard. Wow. Wow. Okay. It's smoking. There's smoke coming out of it. So I alright. So honestly, one thing that happened is there was a better deal, a much better deal that I found on this Blu ray player than there was on any of the playstation. So I was like, well, they've just I'll just do playstation on this. But I'm realizing that my remote control honestly only really operates my TV. So I don't know how I'm gonna jump or anything. And the disc I got is actually for an old it's for a really old PlayStation, and it's covered in gook. Like it's got like toffee on it. And that's probably why it's clicking so much. Dang.
