It's the world's largest made to measure men's wear brand. I was happy to introduce a friend of mine at Indochino recently. This is my friend The Tazmanian Devil, Taz. He is recently sort of back on the market dating wise. He had found that the game has changed. He wasn't used to the proliferation of new dating apps to meet people, sort of an old school guy. So he needed to take some nice pictures for dating apps and to update his wardrobe. I introduced him to Indochino. The suits, the shirts, the coats, and more. I have some Indochino products. I have some pants. That I find are good for formal events and also for casual events and are very comfortable and very reflective of my personal style. Taz, of course, shredded a lot of the clothes initially from spinning around, tazging out. But then he found a fabric that he liked something that was made to measure just for Hammy as like a very large shoulder, like very broad shoulders and sort of very thin bottom part. He got it measured and designed for him at the in the Chino showroom and your you can also do it all yourself at in the Chino dot com. Personalized all the details, lapel, lining, monogram, got it all for under four hundred dollars that almost all their custom clothing is. And now instead of fully tazzing out and essentially becoming a tornado, he just does a very kind of slow, like, present as he's going around so people can see all the angles. So he is still doing his famous spin, but in this slow kind of hey, check this out way and he has done very well on these apps. I don't again, get into too much detail about like his personal life. I don't want to talk about his previous relationship and what happened there or exactly sort of what he's getting into now, but I will just say it is going very very well for him. Out there.

I would like to talk to you about liquid IV If you're trying to drink more water, liquid IV hydrates do two to three times faster, more efficiently than water alone with the added bonus of vitamin c, b three, b five, b six, n b twelve. I'm enjoying it a lot, frankly. I I drink I think I like the lemon lime flavor the best, but I do like a lot of them and I will just pour it in my water, even when I'm not feeling like I necessarily need more hydration, I just I think the taste is good. It has, of course, made Sean very pissed off. We've been through this with a lot of our corporate partners where he tries to make sort of competing product. This time, he has really seized on the idea that, like, liquid IV, like, IVs are normally liquid. So he's like liquid IV. He's keep saying who cares? And so he has invented a product that he calls gas IV, which is he showed it to me. He said, let me show it to you and he brought me outside, and he pointed at what I thought was basically like a cloud. And it turned out was a cloud. And he says, this is my gas IV. It is a gaseous form of water. It holds one trillion gallons of water, and he said that he can unleash it at any time to basically hydrate the entire town at once. So the the most recent development of that is he had a said he had to have a meeting with the gas IV. And so what he did was he went up in a helicopter which he has always enjoyed doing. It's like a big copy of his as flying helicopters around. And he did chop up the the cloud. The gas IV by accident. He got a little too close to it from wanting to be friends with it and he did end up chopping it up big time. So that's an ongoing issue. Liquid idea is the fastest growing wellness brand. All their products are non GMO vegan and free of free of gluten dairy and soy. And you can find it everywhere in even Costco. It's a great healthy alternative to traditional sugary sports drinks, perfect for fueling tough workouts. Preventing muscle fatigue and promoting healthy post workout recovery, and it's available in convenient TSA friendly powder packs for travel. I love liquid I b and I know you will too.
