There's reason number one. What I do is I invite people in from all walks of life, mostly show business and and make them so damn comfortable that they have no but to spill it spill it all. Their trajectory of life and career. And here's some of the great guests that you may tune to as a sampler plate. Tom Hanks, Elon Musk, Sutt Mcfarlane, Brian cranks. That's four names, and now it's the longest interview that any of them have ever given. Tom Hanks for Apple, two hours and forty two minutes. He's a docker. Listen to Kevin Pollock's chat show podcast every Tuesday right here on the Earwalls network. Or wherever you get your podcasts.",
