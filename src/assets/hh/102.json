    "line": "hey, guys. This episode is brought to you by ryan morrison law dot com. If you're a video game developer, you need a video game attorney. And that's not to be confused with a video game attorney, which is the main character of Sean's video game, courtroom scramble, which is actually that's part of why Sean is not here doing this ad. Apparently, Sean's main character in courtroom scramble, whose name is Big Ryan, for some reason, I guess, he's like kind of he's small and he's insecure about the real Ryan Morrison being bigger than he is. So he calls himself bigger I I don't know. But but anyway big Ryan apparently got jealous of Ryan Morrison being an actual lawyer And so Sean went out and somehow got him a license to practice real law and like he passed the Bar somehow even though he's made of of computer information. And so now Big Ryan is is trying a real life sexual assault case. So Sean is is busy getting ready for that. He's doing the programming, so big Ryan can handle it. Although last time I saw Sean has head was stuck in in a backpack. So who knows? But anyway, for real Ryan Morrison Ryan Morrison, a lot of com. Don't let a frivolous cease and desist from a competitor or dispute with a contract to remove your game or app from the marketplace. Ryan Morrison has worked hard to make the legal world a lot less scary for game developers. Head to ryan morrison law dot com or just Google video game attorney to find out more and play courtroom scramble. Alright. Me, John, her CVS, late night munchie run, grabbing Stofers, Frenchbread pizza. Link was in ravioli. Friday's wings. Go to the self checkout scanning. Yeah. John says, check it. Check it. Check it.",

You just gotta to ryan morrison law dot com now to get a free consultation to learn how to protect yourself and your hard work. I we can actually speak from experience with this. Sean is now using Ryan Morrison apparent So this is what happened. Apparently big Ryan, his video game character, who is an attorney for his game, courtrooms scramble. Was representing a woman in this sexual assault trial And through I guess some kind of glitch in the game, I guess, like, he he like froze up something about the programming. You did end up losing the case. The person accused of the assault is free. And because of some circumstances of the try and by the way, he he has said afterwards that he did do this. He did commit this crime, and he says he wants to do it again. And because of some circumstances of the trial, and how big Ryan represented him. He is not allowed to be arrested for any crime ever again. So he has I guess, global immunity is the is the term. So because big Ryan you know, he has been disbarred and he is now being sued for some kind of new lawyer crime that they sort of made up for his behavior, since he is a video game character, he's represented by Ryan Morrison, who is a video game attorney. He used to be a game developer. His company never wanted to call their attorney because each phone call was would result in a hundred dollar invoice. That really sucks. So as a result, you will never be charged for emails or phone calls when you're working with Ryan Ryan, not lying. Tell him the truth more like, He keeps an open line of communication with all clients. You can always feel free to double and triple check things. He's worked with every size member of the game industry, including characters like big Ryan. He knows what what to watch out for wherever you stand whether you're an international success or an indie developer. So please head to ryan morrison law dot com or just Google, video game attorney to find out more. Although, there are a lot of headlines about this big Ryan trial. Apparently, lots of people are trying to delete Big Ryan, and they're writing about that in the news. So the the concrete is going in.
