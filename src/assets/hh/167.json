People podcast meet you know are they killing kids and then capturing their screams and then modifying the screams to make it sound like funny joke from Mike Hamford is John Lennon. Are they doing some third scenario? You know, getting Donald Trump elected so that there's no oversight on the Howell factory and how they do stuff. And all this Who's to say, you know, is this true?

We're here to talk about just the shows that are on Howell. The acclaimed howell original show questions for Lennon is back for a second season and in order to talk about this, instead of getting the news media the liberal elite.
