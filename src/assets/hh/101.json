Don't let a frivolous cease and desist from a competitor or dispute with a contractor, remove your game or app from the marketplace. Here's one thing. One thing I wanna make clear so Ryan Morrison is a video game attorney. He's not a video game attorney. Does that make sense? So he's so he's ryan morrison law dot com and you go there, and this is a real guy, not a video game guy. And what he does is he's doing law attorney stuff that deals with video games, but you can't control him. It's not like you hit you know, be and he jumps over a briefcase or something, that would be a video game inter and that and I'm interested in that and I'm working on that. It's a game, you know, hopefully coming out soon called courtroom scramble. There's a video game attorney and he's, you know, deals the judges gavel and kills the whole jury hits him in the head. But anyway, he's worked hard. The real Ryan Morrison has worked hard to make the legal world a lot less scary for game developers. So head to ryan morrison law dot com or Google video game attorney and you'll find out more. But make sure when you Google it video game attorney, you pronounce it right because otherwise you'll go to my video game attorney, which is still in beta.",

    "line": "Hi, kids. It's a new ad that's kind of like one of the other ones I've done. So are you a video game developer like me? Then you need a video game attorney like Ryan Morrison, who's at ryan morrison law dot com. You go there, you get a free consultation and you learn how to protect yourself and your hard work, and that's in real life you do that. You can also do that in my video game, courtroom scramble, where you can play an attorney not named Ryan Morrison. The real Ryan Morrison worked as a game developer and his company and everyone to call their attorney because the phone call was so expensive. He anyway, that stuff sucks and he's doing the cool way. But the other cool thing is I'm now working on this one part of the video game where this guy gets up to a object and you freaking slice him open an axe off the wall of the it's like a legal axe that's in the in the wall of the courtroom. So you've got enough to worry about when it comes to developing your new game and I do too. I'm having trouble with the graphics. Let alone lawyers charging you an arm and a leg for just legal advice. As a result, you'll never be charged for emails, phone calls, or anything like that. When working with Ryan, he keeps this open line of communication with all clients. And that and the lawyer in my game does too, you are open at any time to hit the smash button and he'll smash whoever's nearby and within the head. And all the clients I lost my spot. Okay. So you're free to double and triple check things with him. And since Ryan's worked with every size member of the game industry big to small, I'm assuming, he knows what to watch for no matter where you stand in the game development world whether you're an international success or a national success or you're an indie developer or whether you're like me and you're just kinda telling your dad about ideas you've had and he is not that impressed. Anyway, don't let a fear of lawyers and a feast stand in the way your successful game development. Head to Ryan morrison law dot com and by courtroom scramble when it comes out, and there's gonna be one part I think if I can figure out how to draw And right now, the game is only on pieces of paper mostly, but there's gonna be one part where there's a lady lawyer that you can, like, give a special kiss to. Anyway, the other thing you could do is Google video game attorney to find out more. Bye. Hey, gang. You're probably wondering which ad is this now, and I'm gonna tell you it's a new ad, and I'm doing it for Harry's razors in Shave Club. So one thing you probably don't know is that the Harry from Harry's razors is actually Harry from Harry and the Henderson's. It's the same guy, but you'd never recognize him because when I saw him now to do the deal for these ads, he is shaven, and that's very impressive. Because if you've seen the film, he's a huge hairy guy and you'd think no one can shave that. But only these razors can and they did it. Normally, shaving is a pain. It's uncomfortable. A razor burn. There's nicks, and it's that's expensive. But now It feels good, and it's cheap because of these guys. It's half the price of other big brand blades, and they ship for Frittia doorstep. And they're better they're made in Germany, and it's fun. And and so so Harry from the Henderson's is there. He's big guy, kind of a weird guy, but he's a shaved guy now and he can go to the store and he can buy whatever. Basically, everything except razor blades. And you're paying thirty two dollars for an eight pack, well, it's not that much. It's sixteen. It's half the price and you get better shave and The starter sets an amazing deal for fifteen dollars. You get the razor, the moisturizer, and shave cream, three razor blades, and use the promo code handbook. That's five dollars off that. Then that's ten total or something? I mean, honestly, you'd have to talk to Harry himself about the details, which is hard. He's got a weird voice thing kind where you're like, you know. But it's shipped to your door and the quality of the shave and the look and feel the product. It's all great. So go to harry's dot com now, and Harry from Harry and The Henderson's will give you five dollars off if you type in the coupon code handbook with your first purchase. First first first purchase. Now I'm talking like him. You have first purchase. That's harry's dot com and enter coupon code handbook at checkout for five dollars and start shaving better today. Hollywood handbook. Oh, yeah.",
