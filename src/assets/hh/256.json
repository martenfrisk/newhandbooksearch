It's about a mystery, and the primary suspect is Logan. But it turns out that there is more happening. It was written by a comic book Man and is directed by Brendan Baker. And it did it did star Richard Armitage as wolverine, who was the red dragon in the handball, who's thorn in the hobbit. But Richard Armadage was mysteriously poisoned by a blue apron a rotten blue apron meal. And so now through a series of events, the new wolverine is chef Kevin. He is the only character. Everyone else was poisoned by Blue Apr Mills that had had different things happen to them. So now it's just kind of a one man show of chef Kevin playing wolverine solving a mystery or running away and running away from the police at the same time. So let's hear just a short clip from wolverine the long night.",
