I do wanna say I I have taken some more time to check it out I think I actually was maybe getting the URL wrong the first time or something. It's actually not an empty computer. It's actually a a computer that's full of great podcasts and great original content. Like for example, if you're suffering from Game of Thrones withdrawal now that season six is over, hardcore Game of Thrones could be a really fun option for you.

What are you talking? Like, I'm I'm Hayes. I'm a host of the show. I enjoy how I was just talking about. And if you haven't signed up yet, you just go to Hollywood. Wait wait.

The only way to get it is to be a member. It costs sixty dollars a month. It's free shipping. You just let these guys handle how to build your build your wardrobe, diversify your look on season. The thing I wanna focus on is there there are four styles, classic casual, forward, and mix. People have expressed some confusion about these styles and like how they're different and like kinda what you would need each style for. Like the situations where when you would need classic close casual close forward close makes close. So they've provided some some situations that will hopefully make it more clear. So I I just read some of these things that they've provided. They say that classic is for the city dance when all the girls in the city are there and they're like ready to party. And you and your friends have like a big coordinated dance that you're gonna do, like you and your male friends have have choreographed a dance that you're gonna do together and you need to all wear the same clothes and be in classic mode And it says, don't worry about getting your clothes messed up because it's a very slow coordinated dance. It's to it's to how do I live by Leanne Rimes. And casual is more for when you and your friends get together to play Domino's. You want something comfortable because you're gonna be sitting on the grass, because you're playing Domino's next to the sidewalk with your friends. And it says that these are the kind of clothes that will make dogs who are passing by wanna sniff you and then like maybe you can like get to talking with the dogs and like maybe like it sort of goes from there. So those are That's classic and casual. We have a post post role for for five four as well and I I'll I'll talk about forward and mix.

And your friend has been, like, talking you up beforehand to all the dogs and you need to, like, it up, you need to be like legendary status. And then it's for it's mainly for the part of the party where the dogs are gathered around in a circle to have their like dog ice cream in the little cups. And you get in the middle of the circle and you do a bunch of like moves like dance moves for the dogs and all the dogs are kind of like spraying ice cream on you from being too excited than licking the ice cream too hard and you're just kind of like vibing off each other. And so mix is like a combination of all and it's like, for when you and your friends are like being human Domino's at a dance, like playing a human game of Domino's, on the floor where you're dressed up like big You know what human dominoes are, you're dressed up like big dominoes you're playing on the floor.
