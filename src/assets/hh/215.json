I went to the eye doctor, and I always dread going to the eye doctor, the annual appointment to review to renew my prescription. Because they have you read that crazy board, the crazy letters on the board, and they sit me down and they put that thing on my face. And they say, look at the read this board. Tell me what you are reading. And the letters to me because my eyes are so crazy. They look like they're saying, look behind you. Like, I'm I'm I'm looking at the word, like, the words on the screen and it says, look behind you. And I and so I keep turning around and the doctor's like, no. Like, look look at the thing, but I keep thinking that he's trying to surprise me. I have this insane eye doctor. And every time I go in, it says something like, do you like, don't tell anyone. You're in trouble. Like, don't make any sudden moves you're in trouble. Some spies are after you or something like that. He it has all these like crazy messages on the thing. It's very scary. I don't like going back there anymore and he always acts like there's nothing when I'm like this that says some weird thing. He always acts like it says something else. Don't keep going back to this insane eye doctor. Just take a five minute vision test from your phone or computer with simple contacts. And you can renew your contact lens prescription and reorder your contacts from anywhere in minutes. You record your eyes up close. I did this. It didn't say any. No crazy messages. Nothing about spies. You record your eyes up close and then you you read the chart and it's normal. It just says letters. It doesn't spell any words. The test is recorded recorded and reviewed by a physician in your state who's normal. Just a nice person. And then you receive a renewed prescription and can order your brand of lenses. I had a great time doing this. It wasn't just like a functional experience for me. Fun. I like using my computer. They have all the brands you're familiar with, including options for astigmatism, multifocal lenses, colored lenses, and more. All at great prices. You never even have to leave home. No more going to the crazy doctor. Chef Kevin, you are thinking of getting contacts just for appearance. Is that right?",
