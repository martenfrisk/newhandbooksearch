It's got all kinds of shows, original series, quotable classics, which are my favorite. Next day, late night stand up specials and more. Do you know how much it is? You're you're holding up three fingers, a nine, and a nine. Yeah. That's right. Three ninety nine a month. And that's no joke, which but the the there are jokes on the on the show. No ads, countless hours of premium HD comedy. You can try it now for free. And I I agree with you. The sound texture did change very suddenly in studio, but the the this is still for sure part of the show. It's definitely not native advertising. I don't even know what that is. You don't need your credit card upfront. You can start as a guest. There are shows like the UCB show, the Side and Happyness show, Sammy Jay and Randy and Rickett's Lane. What what what's what's your favorite? Oh, you're doing, like, a snake. Oh, monty python. Oh, okay. You sort of bragled yourself like a snake. That's funny. The shows are funny.
