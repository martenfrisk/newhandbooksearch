    "line": "hey, guys. It's Hayes. So this weekend is the now here this fast in Anaheim, and we're doing a Hollywood Handbook Show on Saturday, the twenty ninth. Which is the major night of the fest with WTF and Super Rico and how did this get made. And you could still get tickets and now hear this fast dot com. You use code handbook to get twenty five percent off a three day pass. I say we, I really I do think Sean is gonna do it. Right now he is saying that he has something else to do that weekend. I've talked about how he is not happy that the festival is in Anaheim because he has this preexisting issue with Disneyland based on some things that happened there thirty, thirty five years ago. So he right now wants me to announce that he has a competing event that weekend that he wants to promote. Sean has, for Halloween, constructed sort of a parody haunted house, in this underground parking structure called disease neat land. That's like a twisted scary version of Disneyland, but he says it like isn't even as scary as the real Disney corporation and some of the stuff they do. But he's got ride like these parody rides. He's got something called the Tower of terrorism. Which is an office chair that you sit on and somebody dressed up like buzz lightyear wearing a turban and like covered in oil makes the chair like pose the lever and makes the chair descend quickly. It kind of like surprises you. I did previews this past weekend. So I did the ride. He's got a a parody of the Indiana Jones ride called Indiana of Free State of Jones. Because he saw free state of Jones last weekend. He was like really into it. So it's somebody it's Sean. Dressed as free state of Jones and he's like freeing a bunch of women from a car. That's not really a ride, I guess. And then he's got a space mountain parody that I he calls disgrace mountain where you'd go into this room, this kind of like outdoor shed, but it's indoor and it's and the inside is somebody dressed like Donald Duck using a toilet made of money. I don't really know what how that's a space mountain parody. But so anyway, Sean says now to go to disney disease me land. Instead of the now here this fast, he says it's cheaper but it's not real. I think it's like eighty bucks. And he does not know about the banksy Disneyland things up. Please do not tell him about that. But you if you wanna go to now hear this fest, you can go to now hear this fest dot com and you can get tickets there and you can use the code handbook to get the good seats.",
