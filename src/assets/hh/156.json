    "line": "hey, guys. It's Hayes. As of now, we are still gonna do a a Hollywood handbook Live Show that now hear this podcast festival, October twenty ninth in Anaheim, California along with comedy Bang Bang. How did this get made? Mark Mary and other great shows. I say as of now because Sean has this ongoing disagreement with Disney and he lately I don't wanna get into the whole thing. It's like space mountain and goofy and all this stuff. You know what the the story is. But lately he has been putting some stuff about Disney online on a messaging app, not Twitter because I think he's afraid of Twitter. Finding out it's an app called Convo Hoster I guess like a conversation host. Anyway, he's been posting a lot of editorial cartoons about how the his words Disney is extremely corporate and is actually just a big business. It's a lot of cartoons of mickey mouse and Ronald Mcdonald, like eating money. Like it's a lady in the tramp spaghetti and they're each like sucking on one end of the money. A lot of goofy material obviously where goofy is the pope, but he's also the president and the big businessman. And also, Rhonda McDonald. This is like one cartoon where all these guys are sitting around a boardroom table and they're all goofy but it's like goofy in these different outfits and they're drinking champagne while the country is like burning outside, I guess. I think it's like fire outside. Some of the drawing is hard to understand. But I just I wanna say that Sean doesn't really mean this stuff. He's kind of finding his way on some of these new, like, political things he's been reading about. I would still like to do the show. I don't want Disney to get the mayor or somebody to cancel the show. I like the fans. I wanna meet the fans. So if it is still happening, you can check on and now here at this fest dot com. And you can get tickets there as well, and you can use the code handbook when you buy get twenty five percent off on a three day pass and maybe we get some money. I don't think so. No. Definitely not. But come to check and see if it's happening on it. Now here this vest dot com offer code handbook.",
