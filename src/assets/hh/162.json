So today's show is sponsored by Howell FM, and I'm here to tell you about it. I hope you liked the podcast so far. And I wanted to dispel some rumors about my grandfather's company and mine and just say, it's all pitiful, hogwash, poppycock, and the like. The idea that we put nail gun nails into our employees' butts to make them sit and listen to podcast longer. Not true. Someone said that we put industrial staples up into their eyebrows so that they are always sort of have their eyebrows up like, oh, good idea. That's interesting and that's not we don't do that. You you know, listen to a brand new Howell original series which is made in a totally humane way. It's a night called tomorrow with James or Baniac from the Venture Brothers or something and who lose difficult people. So okay. And in this ten episode, comedic noir, James Abaniac and Azul Parsons, which I guess is supposed to be a real name. Star us two Angelenos who stumble upon an intergalactic conspiracy in nineteen fifty eight Hollywood. Oh, that ties in well with the Hollywood hand, but podcast you're listening to. Maybe you'll like this too. As far as some of the rumors about me personally outside the company, that I only eat dolphin meat, roasted dolphin meat, and that's just crazy. You know, I eat normal food. Like beef patties and grown earth product, seed elements. So no Dolphimade for me and I don't have private jets strapped to my feet so that I'm always technically on a private jet even when I'm walking around. That's insane. Anyways, what else? Oh yeah. The show features an all star cast including and give strappy in because I'm gonna lay some big names on you. Andy Rictor, Weird Alankovic, Lauren Laptkus, Baron Vaughn, and more. How'd they get them? To listen to a night called tomorrow in over one hundred and fifty hours of exclusive Howell mini series, go to howell dot f m slash hollywood and start your free trial.
