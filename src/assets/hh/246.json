    "line": "hey, guys. Hey, is here. I wanna tell you about a new show on Stitcher Premium. It's hosted by stand up comics, Shalay with Sharp and Courtney Ferington. And it's called thug passion presents. What? Oh my god. I'm sorry. I I'm just a little thrown. I okay. Goddamn it. So Sean and I have been talking about doing a, like, a rebrand for for Hollywood Handbook for a long time for months, and we were kinda just getting ready to unveil the new version of the show, and I well, long story short, I it looks like we're gonna come up with a new title because now the one we were gonna use is taken. So I guess listen to this thug passion presents, as they share their love for underrated black movies by breaking down teens with comedians and celebrating the influence these films and characters have had in molding today's culture. I and I don't even know if we can still do our or special drink at the beginning of the show or if we have to come up with a new special drink, we were gonna serve a thug passion drink, one part Allize, one part restyle, guaranteed to get the one, the other thing. Boy. I don't know. I guess that's why you don't hang on to this stuff for too long. Or we should sent a letter to ourselves that it was postmarked or something because there's no proof. We were just very excitedly talking about this name. There's no proof it's ours. Well, Fug passion presents is out now on Stitcher Premium. Sentence, I always thought I would say, but not in this context. Go to stitcher premium dot com slash thug passion. And use promo code handbook. His name sucks. No. I hate it. For a free month of Stitcher Premium. At an Italian restaurant. It's where I was with Nate. Cordry and haze, damn poor. That I that yeah. That was me. Yes. Just the two.",

    "line": "Hey, guys. It's Hayes. Wanna tell you about simple contacts There are a million things demanding your time. Contact lenses shouldn't be one of them. Simple contacts lets you renew your prescription and reorder your contacts from anywhere in minutes. I've used it. It the process really is very easy. It saved me a bunch of time and money. Sean has used it too and sort of a different context I guess I should say why he is not here to do ads this week. He as we have mentioned, has been ordering all these contacts that are painted to essentially transform him threw his eyes into whatever, like a b, a witch, a toad, a cheetah, basically, wherever his imagination takes him. And this was very fun for him for a little while. But I guess he got kinda bored with that and he has started taking these painted contacts and grafting them all over different parts of his body. In order to confuse predators, like I where he has told me what some animals do in nature is they get these I they have these eyes all over them, and then the predators come up to them and they don't know something he's something he said is if predator comes up to me, then it looks like I'm looking at it out my butt. Because he has most of the eyes are on his butt. But I think there was an issue with him not encountering enough predators in his sort of daily routine So he has been going to the zoo a lot and kind of slinking around the different cages, especially the cage where they keep the owls. And I was like, is that really a predator? It's not like a huge predator, but he pointed out, I guess, they eat mice and stuff. So I guess it technically is. But and I said, you know, we're trying to make a little joke. And I was like, well, easy to make an owl confuser. Most infused animal, they're always saying who, and he hated that. They need him really mad for a reason. I still I'm not really sure why. So anyway, simple context. You take a quick self guided vision test from your phone or computer. It will be reviewed by a licensed doctor in twenty four hours. You used to be able to choose what animal you want it to be, but I think they've kinda caught wind of this Sean stuff, so they don't offer that anymore. Then you will receive a renewed prescription. You can reorder your contacts, simple, prices are unbeatable. The vision test is only twenty dollars. Compared to employment without which insurance could cost up to two hundred dollars. Though this is not a replacement for your periodic full eye health exam.

Right here on Earwolf. It's hosted by Joe Firestone and Manova Moreno. They play listener created games with comedian guests and live Collins. The show's really funny. Plus some of your favorite ear wolf hosts have been calling in by surprise, like okay. So the copy says, pick two to three that are most relevant to you slash your show. And the options are Matt Gorley, Brian Sophie, Lauren Lapkis, Zach Reno, Tony Newsom, and Michael Ian Black. Wow. I did not want to have to do this. Why would they make me pick between between two or three of these? I they're all I mean, god. This feels terrible. I have to choose who's the most relevant to the show. Okay. Matt Gorley's been on twice. Lapkis, oh my god. They're gonna be so mad. Whoever I don't pick is gonna be mad. Okay. Fuck. Lapkin's gotta be in there. We've done her show. She's done our show, like, three times, I think, plus she's freaking huge. So that's one. And I only have two more. Who's out from this list? Mike Lee and Black has never done the show, but if we if I leave him out, then he well, he's never gonna do it. And he's huge too. Zach Reno, Zach Heineken. I hate to cut him. I hate to do it. But he's a nice guy, and I think I would get the least punishment from him. Brancelffi be pissed, gorally be pissed. Tony would be so pissed. I just did her stitches show.",
