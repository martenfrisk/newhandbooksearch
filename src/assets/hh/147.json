It's me Johnny Fashion here to talk to you about a fashion opportunity, and it's five four clothing, and it's sponsoring the Hollywood Handbook or what could be better. It's an LA based branded and, you know, there's nowhere else to get hooked up like this for only sixty bucks a month. And the only way to get the British to be a member, you can't five five four anywhere else. My name's Johnny Fashion. That's not my birth name. When I was born, I was named Johnny Close, and it became about so much more than clothes when I discovered Five Ford, it became about actual fashion and style. And if five four is the only clothing company that promises that your mommy will say that you're handsome and that you look even better than your daddy. So, you know, they've got proven style authors leading the way. And if anyone has been jealous, of the way your mommy looks at your daddy and that she doesn't look at you. Five fours got you covered. With their four style profiles, asset casual forward and mix. You put on any one of those and your dad is gonna be, you know, left hold in the bag and wondered why his wife, your mommy, is suddenly just like, whoa, this guy looks great. There's free shipping. It's direct delivered to your doorstep. You build your wardrobe and diversify your look. I know I've been diversifying my look lately. I'm Johnny Fashion, and so I've gotta be ahead of the curve. And one thing I've been wearing is a big crazy scarf. That is alive and it's a a chain of bugs. So they don't have that at five four. They are gonna make you wear that, and I wouldn't recommend that you do. I've got a rash on my neck from it. But the stuff they give you never gives you a rash. It only gives you the approval of your mommy in a way that is somewhat strange. So go to five four club dot com. Use the promo code handbook and sign up and get fifty percent off your first two months. That's promo code handbook for two hundred and forty dollars worth of clothing for only sixty dollars. And that offer expires August thirty first twenty sixteen. And with any luck, it'll come back starting right after that. And tell Johnny Fashion sent you. Tell your mommy that.",

Blue Apron's a great company where they send you food and ingredients to make great dinner through the mail and recipes to make great dinners for your family. It's a great company that you sustainably source seafood through Monterey, aquarium, seafood watch. They work with local farms and fisheries. They reduce food waste because they use the exact right amount of food. It's a great company. I endorse using this company. They've also been very generous with us in terms of our our show. They've been very supportive of our show, and we're doing the first, like, show cross promotion with them. This is something that Sean and I spent a lot of time working up and they love it. They're really excited about it. It's the concept is the Ham Blue Gurt sandwich or hamburger sandwich. And it's a blue apron hamburger sandwich, because hamburger sandwich is something that Sean and I mostly Sean say a lot. It's like sort of a great catchphrase of ours. And so you can now turn our that catchphrase into your dinner with Blue Apron and the Hambluesger sandwich. What you have to do is go out and buy a bun split bun or any kind of bun that you, like, slice open yourself, you have to go out and buy the bun yourself. And you can take the blue apron meal and and put it between the two buns. And that's a hamburger sandwich. So for example, this month's meals are spiced pork burgers with goat cheese and cucumber corn salad. In this case, since it is burgers, to do the hamburger sandwich, you will have to make the burger. It probably comes with the buns. But you do have to put it between other buns that you buy yourself. That that's what makes it the hamburger sandwich. There's also the summer vegetable in quinoa bowl with fairy tale eggplants, shashita peppers, and corn. That goes great in the hamburger sandwich. There's also the chicken tinga tacos with summer squash and tomato salsa that comes with taco tortillas when you order for blue apron, but you make the tacos and then you just put them between the two buns and then you eat that. And it is much easier to eat. And and that's a great hamburger sandwich. It's less than ten dollars a meal. You check out this week's menu, and then you get your first three meals free with free shipping. Just the cost of the hamburger buns is the only cost associated with making the hamburger sandwich. And you do that by going to blue apron dot com slash handbook. You'll love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cooked meals between two hamburger buns and making hamburger sandwiches. With blue apron. So don't wait. That's blue apron dot com slash handbook. Send pictures of your hamburger sandwich to to earwif dot com.",
