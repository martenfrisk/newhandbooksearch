And where we left her off kind of at the end is she's going, well, if this isn't a pearl, should I have married that, you know, crocodile man or alligator man, should I never have left. Because that was part of why she left, you know. Mhmm. The reason I think it didn't work is because a lot of the alligator people's movements were too stiff. Mhmm.
