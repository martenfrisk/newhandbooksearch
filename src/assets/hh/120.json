    "line": "Hey, guys. I wanna talk to you about how FM. If you love comedy, then how is for you. It's like the Netflix or Podcasts. It's it's run by a guy named Adam Sachs, who is also the guy who runs Earwolf. Which we do the podcast for. And I only say that to say that, like, I am still doing this ad despite something that happened recently, which is that we Sean and I got a big award from a big magazine, Los Angeles, weekly magazine. It's like huge. Two years ago, and they sent us an email saying that we could get a plaque. And Adam got the email, and he was like, do you guys want this and it really seemed like he didn't wanna hang it up in the office. And it just seems like we got this recognition. And and oh, by the way, there are plenty of other plaques hanging up in the office for awards at other shows have gotten they're not like, shows not necessarily like raking in awards recently other than this one. But, you know, there's like one from two thousand twelve for how did this get made? And that's on the wall. But, you know, for us, he's like, oh, like, do you go like, do you guys want this or something? Like, it's dumb. When it's like, no. It's not dumb. It was like a big deal. Very there were only podcasts to get that award that year. And you like, you you know, it's like, why are these other ones important enough to hang on the wall and not us. And like the shoes, the funny shoes that guy did, why do Sean and I have to share one shoe and yet like plenty of other teams get to, like, get their own shoe. Fogoness has his own shoe? Why do they put Fogoness and Kevin pollock on one shoe like ours is? But I am still doing this ad because I don't care. You know, it's not like I don't let it interfere with doing the ad. It's like Netflix or Podcasts. You get access to Super ego for if you're out in Class complete woman and hardcore Game of Thrones. Complete woman is Amanda London Maria Blusucci, and that's funny. And we were funny enough, I guess, to get this award. And I don't know if it's like a like a game, if it's like some kind of because he's definitely making me think about it, and I don't know if that's, like, what he wants. How did this get made a word as a webby? It's like a best web stuff from two thousand twelve. This is just for everything. They awarded a basketball player the same year as we did, and we were, like, the best podcast out of all of them. How did this get me? It is in the How archives. And so I guess Adam Sachs would love to listen to that show. So he he he should he should definitely subscribe. And there are plenty of other Hal originals like the Canon commentaries when they talk about their favorite movies and super ego forgotten classics and and stuff like that. And it's all on your phone for only four ninety nine a month. And, of course, by the way, nothing in this ad about our show. I have no idea whether you know, I know the WTF is on there and comedy Bang Bang and how did this get made. But like Hollywood Handbook is not in that same category. Oh, and by the way, there's plenty of space on the wall. There's like almost too much empty space. On this like, maybe you're thinking that, like, there's it's just too crowded. No. There's, like, a huge huge amount of of open space and stuff to put it up with. It's four ninety nine a month. Use a promo code Hollywood at checkout. It's how dot f m and it's promo code Hollywood and for a one month free trial. And so that'll really be nice for Adam Sachs. And, you know, maybe then he would like to do something nice for somebody else.",
