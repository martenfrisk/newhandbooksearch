And the farmer goes out back, and he sprays hose on it, and he's going to the well, and he's filling up buckets of water, and he's splashing around it. But the fire is, you know, threatening to joy all of his crops, and he and he doesn't really know what to do anymore. And finally, he decides, I'm gonna call the volunteer fire department. Now it's a brand new fire department. He doesn't really know these guys. He doesn't really know if they're up to snuff, but he doesn't know what else to do. So he calls the volunteer fire department, and he's not really sure what to expect. And his friends have been trying to keep the blaze under control, but it's just not happening. So the fire truck comes roaring in, and he thinks, like, are these guys gonna be able to handle it? And in fact, they drive into the middle of the blaze, all the way to the center of the fire. Everyone jumps out of the car and starts effectively controlling the fire and putting out the flames and doing everything they can in their power and they and they put it all in the farmer standing there with his buddies and they are impressed. They go, these are the bravest motherfuckers I've ever seen in my life. Like, I can't believe this. The fire goes out. The farmer comes over. He shakes the hand of the head of the volunteer fire department. He goes, man, that was so impressive. I can't believe it. I know you guys don't normally get tipped, but I'd like to give you something. I'm gonna give you a thousand dollars. And the firefighter goes, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. And then he says he says, no, no, that's fine. And then one of the friends goes, hey, that's a pretty nice tip. You got any idea what you're gonna do with the money and the firefighter goes well, first things first, I'm gonna get the brakes fixed on this truck.",
