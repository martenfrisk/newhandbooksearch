Because I told him that the story of Bolt actually happened to my friend, Ashley, who's a who's a boy, his dog. Because his dog was a TV star who's owner, my friend Ashley, who's a boy, got kidnapped by a scientist and bolt had to save him. And then he became a movie and voiced by John travolta. Dontrobolta. But I I know jokes. Because I told Paul this, which I don't like to talk about because my friend got kidnapped. And he said I was being a faker. And I got really pissed. I told him to shut up. And then And then Paul made an entire show to tell me to shut up. Now he's making me be nice about it on my show. So That's what's happening. And so I know you showed up as Fusion's weekly news show with Hosting comedian, Paul fompkins, meant to give you weeks' worth of global news, pop culture, and politics in thirty minutes. It's got jokes, puppet debates, and special guests, yes, I said puppets. One is actually a hot dog named Hot Dog, which I think is also directed to me like I think Like, I have a crush on Bolt or something. Like I think he's hot, which I don't.
