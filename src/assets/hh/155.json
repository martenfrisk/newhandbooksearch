And who's the sponsor gonna be? You're all wondering, and I'm building the suspense and who's bringing you this show this week. And uh-oh, it's ZipRecruiter, which is the website dot com, so you know it's a big one. And how wouldn't what in the heck are we gonna use ZipRecruiter for Uncle Sean? Well, I can tell you the truth. Okay? You are gonna use it for when you have a job opening, I'll come up with a quick example at the top of my head. Your doorknob repairman and need somebody to go break all the doorknobs off a house so that the person needs to hire you and you need somebody very stealthy And so you don't wanna put your job listing on just one website because then you only get just the people who go to that website literally just that one, and maybe you get somebody who ends up getting you arrested because they are not sneaky, like, haze and like me. And so you don't wanna go to jail and get arrested. Do you doorknob salesman? No. You wanna go to zip recruiter dot com instead. Then you listed on all the top job sites. Yeah. That's right. Over a hundred plus job sites, including social media networks like Facebook and Twitter, all with a single quick click. And you find candidates in any city even if it's a city with a crazy name like some of the names in the cities in this country, you guys. I feel like I'm losing touch. The new cities they're coming up with now, they're out of control. I saw one city the other day, the name But Montana. You think I'm making it up? It's real. So anyway, even if you're in But Montana, you can use zip recruiter dot com. It's got an easy interface. You can quickly screen candidates, rate them, hire them fast. Find out today why they've been used by over a million businesses, and one business that hasn't used them actually so far has an ear wolf, and they'll start using them now because we're doing the ad, and they listen to us. But they didn't use them before, and some of the people they hired, this one lady named Dana, I mean, you guys don't know her. It doesn't mean anything to you. She works here. She's like a freaking corporate robot psychopath. Who only cares about numbers and the bottom line. And I heard the way they even hired her is she did did a psychological test for the government And they said, you could either go work at earwolf or be an assassin because she has no conscience. And and I think she actually does both, because a lot of times she takes a long lunch and she comes back and she's out of breath, like, maybe she was doing assassinations. Anyway, that's Dana. I hope she doesn't listen to this. So right now, my listeners can post their jobs on Zip recruiter dot com for free by going to zip recruiter dot com slash first. That's zip recruiter dot com slash first. One more time try it for free. Go to ziprecruiter dot com slash first. Get all the sites. Don't get just one site.
