And so here's a great way to shop at Amazon while supporting earwolf from Wolfpop to Oh, Amazon's so good. I'm always on their shopping for swing sets to put in my backyard so that more children will wanna complain in my yard because I'm still a big kid at heart and I still tend to eat dessert first, you know. And I can buy that on Amazon too. I go there to get this s'more flavored mochi ice cream. It's like a Japanese delicacy or something and it's so good. Anyway, If you go to earwool for wolf pop dot com slash amazon, it'll take you to the same Amazon you know and love, but hold up. Wait a minute. Something's different and it's that It's not that the prices are different. They're the same, but it's that you're gonna give a sweet kickback to earwolf or Wolfpop, and that's who pays my bills and and that's you listened to Hollywood Handbook, although Amazon did not buy an ad directly on their show, just sort of a general deal with Yo Wolf that they're reading in place of an ad. Anyway, engineer Cody out y'all.",

Normally, an ad would go on this space and we did get into sort of a knock down drag out fight with the Wolfpop people. They wanted us to talk about a new show they're doing on our show. But as you know, we only talk about our show on our show. And that's part of what makes it so good. Anyway, this Hollywood lesson that's replacing the ad is just a little advisement that we're giving you on how to promote yourselves properly. So what they want us to talk about is something called cardboard exclamation point with Rich Summer. By the way, Scoop Chopper's Rich Summer is a great fake name that this guy's come up with for himself because people love feeling rich and they love the heat and warmth of the summertime and the clothing gets smaller around that time of year. Anyway, he's doing some cardboard thing and it's got an exclamation point and it's about board games and I don't know what board games he's gonna talk about on that probably candy candy candy men game or kid stuff. But we've got an adult board game that we want to promote and it is the Hollywood Handbook board game and Hayes is drawing it right now as we speak and it looks freaking awesome and his drawing has gotten so much better. And he is drawing now some of the engineer blocks that you try to avoid when you roll the dice and I'm writing out some of the cards of the great guests that you can draw and some of the cool segments like Gmail Rulad or that's really interesting that you can do with your friends to have fun with your friends and take pictures of yourself playing it and send it to us. So I guess you know, listen to cardboard exclamation point with Rich Summer and tune into the episode that I'm sure is coming soon where he talks about the Hollywood Handbook board game. His show's Thursday's on Wolfpop. And be good to each other and don't ever lie to me. I always know if you're lying.",
