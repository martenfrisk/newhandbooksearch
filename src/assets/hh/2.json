And he's a stud on the court, but he's sort of a dud in the dating game until he is dispatched to the moon Pandora. On a unique mission. And he starts to feel sort of torn between like following his orders and protecting this new world that he sort of is starting to feel like is his home. And I don't wanna give too much of it away. But Danica Patrick plays the Big alien. And to see somebody like David Allen Greer, who I have actually heard from somebody who made it did not know that he was in this movie, go through this experience of going to this new land and like seeing it all for the first time and really genuinely thinking is real. Like, that that, you know, it got me, honestly. I I cried a lot.",
