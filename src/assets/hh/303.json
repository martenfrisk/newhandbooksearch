    "line": "hey, guys. It's Hayes. Sorry about the echo. I'm in sort of a waiting room area. I wanna tell you guys about Squarespace. Squarespace is a place where you can turn your dream into a reality. It makes it easier than ever to launch your passion project, whether you're looking to start a new business, showcase your work, publish content, sell products, and more Squarespace is the tool for you. They have these great templates created by world class designers. The ability to customize just about anything with a few clicks. You can easily make a beautiful website yourself. So I we've talked about in the past, like Sean sort of set up a competing operation to Squarespace called Sean's base that he did actually get off the like, registered the URL, got, like, the site up and running, and it was kind of just like an empty page for a while. And a couple hours after that, it was hacked by anonymous. And they then used it to create a site that is very mean about George w Bush. You can still go to the site to Sean's base and he does encourage you to, like, please click on the ads. I think busted tees is actually a new advertising partner with him. But he asked that you do not click on the images of George w Bush. As a donkey or as Alfredi Neumann. There are some images from the show, Little Bush on there. Please stay away from those. He said they are infected with something. I'm the waiting room I'm in. He I guess, because of the page, got a call to be, like, recruited by I mean, I think it is ISIS. I, like, just based on, like, some of what the company they didn't say that's who it was, but he had me drive him to, like, go to this meeting that he's, like, very excited about. And I'm just, like, kind of hanging on the waiting room. And he is taking credit for this page that I know that he did not do. Last time, I kinda talked to him about it. I think he had sort of forgotten about George w Bush. Anyway, Squarespace's powerful ecommerce functionality lets you sell anything online. Analytics help you grow your site in real time.
