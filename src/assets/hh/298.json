    "line": "hey, guys. So sort of a crazy situation that I'm in right now. This is Sean Clement. I'm doing the ads. Hayes is not available. He is in a courtroom right now awaiting trial to give a little bit of backstory. I think most of you probably know A judge was forcing Hayes to do his LA podcast show. If you guys know about this, it's like a community service thing. That Hayes had to do because he was captured, he was caught spray painting large pine cones making them gold and selling those on late night television to senior citizens and claiming they were like commendations from congress and the president and they were like medals of honor or something. It was charging extremely high rates. You're not allowed To do that, he had these like false certificates that came with them. Anyway, so he had to do LA podcast which extensively is a good thing. Unfortunately, recently, the district attorney did start listening and playing some of those episodes backwards, and it turns out that he, along with his Krony's co conspirators was still selling the pine cones through. Subliminal messagery. If you play the LA podcast episodes backwards, he is ripping off your grandma and grandpa. And making them think that they're getting like war medals. And it's just it's just big pine cones. So anyway, this adds for Mac Weldon. Whatever you're wearing right now, Mac Weldon is better. It's a premium men's essential brand that believes in smart design, premium fabrics, simple shopping. I'm sure Hayes, you know, is wearing his Mac Weldon's right now. He's probably wearing the silver underwear and shirts because they're naturally antimicrobial, which means they eliminate odor and he must be sweating. Here he is going in front of the same judge who last time didn't award him any jail time and kinda generously gave him a window out. And it looks like the window is slamming on his hands right now and hurting his hands. If you don't like your first Parac weldens, you can keep it and they'll still reach fun to you. No questions asked. I know you know, I wear them. I put on these pants. I just traveled. I just flu recently and I'm wearing these Mackweldon a sweat pant. I'm wearing them in the airport, and I'm comfy as all get out. So for twenty percent off your first order, visit mackweldon dot com and enter promo code the boys at checkout And please, if you can write a letter or anything to the judge and just say that, hey, brought you a lot of joy and that he shouldn't necessarily be viewed strictly through the prism of this one crime which is bad and which he has done multiple times now. That would help. I'd love to keep doing the show. I don't wanna have to go",

    "line": "Okay. Sean Clements again. Still kinda freaking out. Hayes just gave his testimony and it went really badly. He started responding to every question with a question like when the attorney would be like, you know, have you knowingly defrotted the elderly for their life savings and he would say, well have you ever done that counselor and the counselor would say no. You know, I'm not the one on trial here and then Hayes would go, are am I the one on trial here and they go yes. So anyway, it didn't it didn't look good. He seemed happy with it. But for the most part, People were not liking it. So anyway, I just ran out to do this other ad. It's you know, it's a new sponsor, which I never want to establish the tone of how we advertise these products without him here. But my hands are tied and his hands are cuffed. He's They put him in cuffs because he was doing He kept stealing the gavel. He wasn't like trying to hurting with it. He just was Just was like, this is mine. And then the judge would take it back and he'd go, really. Are you sure that's yours? I have one that looks just like that. But anyway, So this one's for sheets. It's my sheets rock and I have looked at the website. It's great. I've looked at the sheets. They're really cool. I, of course, have ordered mine already.

So anyway, the worst part of all of this, obviously, is that I am not allowed to do ads for away luggage. Traditionally, I have gotten very saucy with their copy. I know, hey, has so much on his plate, this is maybe the least of his worries, but he would be worried if he knew that I was doing it away out by myself. So I'm going to be on my absolute best behavior, I'm going to try to stick to the copy. As I mentioned, I recently traveled at my a sweat pant and I was comfy and I did use my away luck It was great luggage. They worked. They offer a high quality luggage at a much lower price by cutting out the middleman and selling directly to you. You could choose from nine colors and four sizes carry on, the bigger carry on, both of which are compliant with all major US airlines, the medium or the large. All suitcases are made with German, polycarbonate, which is lightweight and unrivaled and strengthened impact resistance, then the three sixty degree spinner wheels guarantee a smooth ride. You know, I can attest to that. Best of all, both sides of the carry on are available to charge anything that's powered by USB cord and thanks to the lifetime warranty. If anything breaks, away, we'll fix or replace it. Try it for a hundred days and I'm just one second. I'm so sorry. I'm just trying to do the away ad. I understand. I understand I'm going to jail. I get that. Do you get that I have a podcast ad to do? Thank you. Yes. That's the sheriff. Try it for one hundred days if at any point you decide it's not for you. Return it for full refund. No questions asked. You know, again, I just traveled with it. I used it it's great. I think I've basically gotten out of this by not saying anything untoward, like for instance, pointing out that if you replace this, a with an r, it spells awry and then it would be awry travel and kind of implies things are going awry. It's not Hasn't happened, you know, but That is what it would spell. That's all I'm gonna say. For twenty dollars office suitcase, visit awaytravel dot com slash the boys twenty and use promo code the boys twenty during checkout. That's awaytravel dot com slash the boys twenty and use the promo code, the boys twenty for twenty dollars off a frigging suitcase. And I'm and now I'm done and yes, you can, yes, you can now.
