Wanna explain something, Sean, of course, has been spending a lot of time developing, not a competing site, but also a site along with Squarespace. Called Sean Space, that has had a number of different, like, purposes over the years. I don't really remember what any of them were necessarily, but most recently so he realized that he had this space that was mostly not like web developed. It was it was like white. It was like a white page. And he said, hey, this is like a a canvas. For a, like, painting. It's it's white in that same way. And so what if this were a space Sean Space for the entire Internet to come and, like, do designs and express themselves and, like, write ideas, and it, like, could be a space where, like, everyone on the Internet could kinda come together and create this incredible, like, a mural of ideas and drawings And it could be this way, are we able to understand each other a little better, and it could be a way to get peace. And so he advertising, you know, he like goes out there and he tells people that, hey, you go to Seanspace, and you can do a drawing, and you can write an idea, and it's it's gonna be like such a nice thing. And he goes home, to see what people wrote on Sean's bass or Drew. And the only thing that was on there is somebody wrote the doo doo man. And Sean so that is that was kind of the last I heard from him He was on his way to buy a pair of handcuffs. And I don't know what he's got I don't know how he's going to find the doo doo man, what like the what the next step is, but that I mean, really it's just an update on why I am doing the ads myself today, which is fine.

Beautiful templates, the ability to customize just about anything, you can easily a beautiful website yourself. And if you do get stuck, Squarespace's twenty four seven award winning customer support is there to help. I do have a little update on Sean. So Sean, of course, created this his site, Sean Space converted it into basically a Canvas for the entire Internet. To do drawings and ideas on and an effort to bring peace. And when he went and told people about it, the only thing that someone did on it was write the doo doo man and Sean was going he was going to buy a pair of handcuffs related to this somehow. So it turns out he he has found the doo doo man. He took his computer to, like, some kind of, like, a special lab, and they were able to through a combination of handwriting analysis and IP tracking, they we're able to conclude what a lot of us, I think, kinda, suspected, which is but the the backpack kid is the doo doo man. The kid from the Katie Perry video and who invented the the dance that is the floss dance. So the backpack kid and it makes sense because Sean had been sort of it and, like, making fun of him earlier that day as he was, like, going around telling people about Sean space. He did he yelled it. He's something to get him from his car. So the backpack kid wrote the doo doo man on this on Sean's space. And Sean did find some handcuffs. He bought a pair of handcuffs, and he did go try to handcuff the backpack kid who is, of course, impossible to handcuff because of the floss dance. The way he is doing that dance, you cannot get a pair of handcuffs on them. You'd like you can try and wait for until he swings his arms to one side, but maybe you're gonna get one. And if you are holding the other side of the handcuff, he is going to rip your hand basically off as he swings his his arms back in the other direction. So Sean got hurt. He is I I believe he is resting at home. So that's good. To me, that's a happy ending. Head to squarespace dot com slash the boys for a free trial.

We we everyone was making fun of me even the Babe who was pushing most of the guys down the slide. And I got some fried dough which was pretty delicious.

    "line": "way around the pillow. Everyone everything is dreaming about something else, which is true. And then it loops back around. I like, I accidentally ran out of space, and so I have a baseball bat that is dreaming about the mouse? Because that's just like there when it looped around, there wasn't enough room to put another thing in between. So I just have to, I guess, figure out a story for why that would be happening. Guys, the easiest way to ease back into a post summer routine, simplify the morning and evenings with an electric toothbrush from Quip. Time sonic vibrations offer an clean that's gentle on your sensitive gums in just two minutes twice a day. So I guess this is that's like one way to do it for sure. For me, this is the time of year end of September, like, after I have gone back to school for a couple weeks. This is when I will do all my tooth brushing for the entire year. I will just carve out a week I will not go to school and just get it all done. So two minutes a day, Twice a day. That's four minutes a day times three hundred and sixty five. So I will basically just brush my teeth for over a thousand minutes. And that saves me, I feel like, from having to, like, go like, oh, I'm doing something else. Oh, no. I gotta go brush my teeth. It's, like, actually making the time for this very important thing, but just like doing it all at once. And I'll, like, rent a place. I'll let go up the coast, and I'll rent a place, and I'll brush my teeth for over a thousand minutes. And the multiuse cover works as a stand and mounts to mirrors, putting brushing front and center in your bathroom. So obviously, if you do it the way I do it, you do not need to be reminded throughout the year with a stand or whatever. You can basically put it away until next year. Better yet, the lightweight compact design means you can bring it along with you on those last summer weekend getaways. So that is useful to me. And brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just five dollars, making it easy to stay committed to your oral health. Don't need them. I I love Quip. I love the toothpaste. I love that it tells me when I'm done brushing. Good products. And that's why I love Quip and why it's perfect for getting back into a routine. Quip starts at just twenty five dollars. And if you go to get quip dot com slash the boys right now, you can get first refill pack for free. That's your first refill pack for free at g e t q u I p dot com slash the boys.",

I just I got the proportions I don't know what happened. Something went wrong. I drew all these guys on it, and it's just not really useful for anything right now. I'm I'm hoping I can cut it in some way to make like twenty pillows. But then with the like, I'm cutting the drawings. I don't know. And then I see this ad. So that first, that happens. Then I see this ad. Hey there. It's Sean and Hayes says at the beginning. Oh, that's that doesn't sound right looking around. Oh, just Hayes. It says, Earwold has a brand new podcast. It's hosted by Paul f Tomkins and Nicole Parker, and it's called The Neighbor Listen. And I'm reading this and I'm like, hey, that sounds like something I could probably be on someday. Like, I know Paul of Hopkins. He's been on the show, so many times, he we did his show. We're friends with him. We see him around the office. We love Paul. You see him outside of work. And Nicole Parker did our show. She was in Nicole popcorn, and everybody remembers that. And then I kinda start to re I'm reading this and it's like, it's an improvised show set in the suburbs where Paul and Nicole's characters keep up with the town's latest by its local social network app and interview their odd neighbors. And so I'm kinda I'm listening to this, and I'm kinda thinking, like, that sounds like they did a lot of these already. Possibly all of them. Paul's been on tour. It's like it sounds like they banked. A ton of just like when you're reading an ad, you can just kinda tell when they have banked so many of these. And I didn't do any of the of the ones that they banked. I know that. So you just feel things like, you get excited about something that's a pillow, it's the doing the neighborhood listen, and then you just, like, look back at it, and you're just kinda like, what hap something has gone wrong. What did I do? The neighborhood listen is only available on Stitcher Premium. So go to stitcher premium dot com slash neighborhood and sign up with the promo code handbook. You'll get a free month of premium and you'll be supporting our show too. Thank you.",
