So you gotta believe me when I tell you that I'm trying to talk about hims with you. Now, normally, Hayes Davenport is in the ad with me stopping me from doing some of my moves, which is telling you about how Hims while they do provide a good solution for some of the issues that they are trying to solve It's not the only thing you can do. I have some ideas too that might fix it. Basically, forty percent of men by age forty struggle from not being able to get maintain an erection. But the good news is, the holiday seasons upon us and Hims has the biggest black Friday deal of them all. This is a big black Friday deal for you guys, and you can try a free online visit to get started with him. Dude, I have been to the website and I have to tell you, it is a flesh colored website, which there's no doubt about it. That's sensual. If you can find a more central website that Hims, congratulations because for me, It's the tops. The freaking whole thing looks like skin. So Hims connects you to realize that the doctors and FDA approved pharmaceutical products to treat ED, they offer well known generic equivalents to name prescriptions and answer all your questions in a confidential chat with their doctors. And if you're approved by the doctor, products are shipped directly to your door. I have dims. DIMs to me It's cheaper than him's. Basically, what it is, it's a light bulb that's so dim that your lover can't tell you're soft. So I don't really know what the next step is beyond that, but it at least is a path to trickery which provides you with more options than being in a well lit room. A lot of people wanna go to Hims. My solution is cheaper or it will be. We're trying to get the production cost of the light bulb down. Currently, I'm making all of them by hand and DIM is maybe a misnomer, they don't work at all, so it is pitch black when you put them in your lip. Anyway, you could try hymns today by starting out with a free online visit. Go to four hymns dot com slash handbook. That's f o r h I m s dot com slash handbook, for him dot com slash handbook. It would go for dims, you would go to four dims, f o u r d I, m m z slash handbook. I couldn't get handbook. Prescription product are subject to doctor approval and require an online consultation with a physician who will determine if prescription is appropriate see website for full details and safety information. This could cost hundreds if you went in person to the doctor officer pharmacy or to dims quite frankly. Remember, that's four hymns dot com slash handbook. Have fun and be safe out there.",

And I would say that I am either the main guy or one a or possibly two or possibly two b or three out of the podcast guys who do this show. So You know you can trust me. When I tell you that airplane flying is uncomfortable, can I get a hell yes? When I tell you there's a solution, can I get a, oh, yeah, that sounds nice? When I tell you that if you don't buy the turtleneck pillow, t r t l, turtle pillow for your neck, that you're basically saying to airplane, which is being uncomfortable at you, hey, I'm just gonna sit here and just take it like a chump, then What are you gonna do about me saying that? Are you gonna friggin just accept that your life is worse? Because you're not putting on the pillow, which I, as promised, did put on and hung out in my living room, sat in a rocky chair for a little while at just chill with it. Picture that. If you don't buy it, I'm pissed. Seriously, the turtle travel pillow is scientifically proven to provide better support than the usual u shaped neck pillow. I felt that. The secret of turtle travel pillow is its internal support structure which flexes your head and keep you upright. I felt that. And when they told me its patent design fits any neck draw and shoulder shape, I felt that shit. It's proven to work with over a million sold in eleven thousand reviews. It's the most reviewed travel pillow on Amazon. They may get their business as all of your travel with their range of innovative travel accessories from the new pillow plus to packing pods and a collection of award winning compression socks available and loads designs. I gotta try these socks next. I wonder what the designs are. Let's go to the website and check them out next time I do an app for these guys. I can promise you that I liked it. And I am gonna fly next week and I am gonna wear it. Flying can be comfortable thanks to turtle unless you're just gonna sit and freaking take it from the plane. That's t r t l travel dot com that you wanna go to. You get twenty percent off with the code the boys. Twenty percent off at t r t l turtled travel dot com with the code, the boys.
