    "line": "hey, now. Your goons and cartoons, time for another of your favorite ads from your favorite podcast host. You gotta keep the lights on. Know what I'm saying. So here's a little twenty to thirty second spot. Although I got a feeling it's gonna be a bit longer. It's about Second City training center, and let me tell you a little of the copy they have. You don't have to be an SNL hopeful to take classes at the Second City training center. You don't even have to live by their Chicago l a or Toronto locations. Hundreds of students take comedy writing and fly in for the five day summer and winter emersion. Now a lot of people are going, okay, Sean, but you're so funny and you didn't necessarily train it second city. And famously, I use all the products in our ads. If you see the photos for this episode, those are five four jean shorts that I have on And next week, I'll make them take a photo of the label. But anyway, yeah, I wear five four jeans shorts. I sleep like GED baby on a freaking Casper mattress. So how can I advertise second city training center? Well, you're right. I didn't take classes there, because I'm so naturally funny, but one of the other hosts you like, Hayes Davenport did go there and did do a lot of training there. They actually made him do course several dozen times. They kept refusing to graduate him, and they said he was never gonna be able to make it. And it turned out that all he needed was to take it one more time to give them the money get the comedy training to get his chops up. And then when he encountered someone like me who's just kinda naturally funny and doesn't really need all the like school stuff for it, He was able to almost keep up with some of my shit in a way that made me go, hey, wait a minute. This guy might be able to be the host and I'd be a good sidekick for him. So if you wanna, you know, put yourself in a position to succeed, sort of be able to kind of leave it up on the rim and let gravity do the rest like Hayes did, Go ahead. Go to second city dot com back slash t c or call three one two six six four three nine five nine. Please don't prank call that number wink to find the best class to advance your entertainment career. Make new friends or polish up your presentation skills. That second city dot com backslash t c or call three one two six six four three nine five nine. And hopefully you meet someone just with the naturally funny, just funny in their bones like me and, you know, you combine that with some of that training and you might wind up with a great host side kick dynamic like we have here on Hollywood Handbook. Thanks for listening to the show and thanks for everything else that you do out there. I know my fans all do a lot of charity work and to keep keep it up and probably gonna wrap up the ad soon. I've done all the copy and I've sort of, you know, run out of stuff to say about the topic at hand and I really wanna get us back into the show. So I'm just gonna leave off saying, Thank you. I love what you guys do. You're out there. You're making a difference for people. That's great. I miss you guys. Those of you you know, who I've interacted with directly. And even those who you who I haven't, you know, I miss your spirit because we're all connected. I really believe that. I don't know if you study science stuff at all. I mean, I'm obviously thinking about starting to do that, and I'm sure there's some scientific stuff that says we're connected. So so the ads pretty much over Getting out of the ad, wrapping it up, and there's not gonna be any more ad stuff to do. I said at the top, it's only gonna be twenty thirty seconds and I'm over that by a good margin about crossing minute four here. So let me just say second city dot com back slash t c or three one two six six four three nine five nine, Hayes took their classes. You've seen some of what he gets done out there and you might be able to do even better because you might be starting with. Some talent and not have it be all technique. All what Hayes is doing is it's a repeatable pattern. It's all things that he's learned, but he didn't have any innate ability to begin with. So if you've got anything, you could launch past and I could be your sidekick somewhere down the line. So that's the end of the ad, closing the ad, finishing the ad, and not gonna do it anymore. So I'll see you when I see you and do I have anything to plug in the ad? I guess my podcast, I guess Hollywood Handbook. You know? Listen Hollywood Handbook it's a great show. I'm really proud of it. I'm happy it's not over, and I will I'll be I'll see you in the funny pages. Okay. Thanks much. Alright. I love you and I'm in love with you. Bye. So it's the holidays. It's me. I'm hanging out with My normal Christmas crew. It's me. It's Cormick McCarthy, Jean Triplehorn, and miss Pacman from video game. Glicic Pacman. She's got a boat. Two guys, two girls, you know, it's sort of like a double date y vibe, but it's also Christmas, so we're keeping it not necessarily sexual between us. And we're making gingerbread cookies, like something that people do at that time of year. And And Jean, Triple Horn points out that it's kind of unfair, you know, that it's always gingerbread men. And that's not a fair representation. And I've been really big on gender equality just for the past couple months and saying, like, this is actually kind of a cool idea. So we start making pretty pronounced camel toast and some of the gingerbread characters. And they're getting bigger and bigger. And it's starting to get a little scary. Because if that's what it looks like sort of through the pants then what's inside. Exactly. You know? And at a certain point, is that what I like? Is that something, you know, potentially medical? And so you know, we're still also trying to put on, like, some sprinkles and some frosting and some other normal stuff. But pretty much without any of us saying it, all of our attention becomes focused on these gingerbread camel toast. And and it's no longer just on some of them. It's on all of them. And Sorry, Sean. Yeah. Go ahead. You're you're missing a normally you start out with the what The what? Oh, the what what was Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So so sorry. Well, I'm here with Lamar, you know, say hey.",

He's in a lot of cool stuff and people think he's really funny. I think he was on this comedy bank being five hundred episode, which I was pointedly not invited to. And so then it's like, okay, great. He's doing better than me. Good for him. Funny guy. Nice guy. You know? Funny guy. But then it's like, then I do an ad for him. Okay. You're well, thanks. Maybe have him do an ad for me so that I can be doing better than him. So anyway, that's one idea. So here's the info. He has a show. It's called Strictly Business. You know, no coincidence. I talk about the business. You know, mine's even more specific because I talk about show business, but then he's, like, broadening it out. So again, I'm even more fans and have even more stuff and just eating my lunch. Drew Tuber plays Derek Contreira, a former pro skateboarder who has left the world of extreme sports. Oh, those might. Oh, I love extreme sports and retiring. Anyway, he be wants to be the next great American entrepreneur, join him as he launches his epic ass business empire and talks tightens the industry. Then that's like Titans of the industry and that's like Shark Tank. And I used to do reality show show with haze and we did stuff about Shark Tank. I hate seeing this guy succeed. The five episode mini series features an all star cast including, are you kidding me? Scott Ockerman, Paul of Tomkins Lauren Lab because John Gabris and Mary Holland. You know, I asked all those people to do freaking my Stitcher Premium show and only one of them did it. Get a month of Stitcher Premium for free by going to stitcher premium dot com slash strictly business. It's his code. Oh, no. Wait. Sorry. I didn't finish strictly business and using the code Hollywood. So it's my code. So use my code to listen to his things, to get even more fans and do, like, a shark tank thing which I like. Extreme sports, which I like, and business, which I'm doing anything about business too, and get all that, and just good for Drew, and just seeing him succeed and do so great and then I'm just stuck doing the same crap I always have done. That's stitcher premium dot com slash strictly business and code Hollywood or whatever. This has been an earwolf production, executive produced by Scott Ockerman, Chris Bannon, and Colin Anderson.
