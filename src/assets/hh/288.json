Fillow has over fifty of your favorite channels like Discovery, HGTV, Comedy Central food AMCVH one IFC MTV A and e nickelodeon Lifetime and History. Of course, we have talked about this product service in the past, and Kevin, our producer has been given the opportunity to do his character that he's developing, Phil Obuster, sort of a political comedy character. Philow is very unhappy with this character, and we told him we we told him that that's fine. We can just have Kevin not do it anymore. We don't like it either. We're happy to just have him not do it. But they said that wasn't enough and they did release a very mean scary dog to chase Kevin up a tree where he still is, but, of course, Kevin is vegan and has become very hungry and is eating the tree. And so now as in kind of a dangerous situation where as he eats, the tree becomes small and in this way and is actually he's eating his way towards this big scary dog, which looks like it has a lot of energy and can stay up all night.

Guys love the wide selection of high quality fabrics and colors, not to mention the option to personalize details including your lapel, your lining, your pockets, your buttons. Quick note about I guess just the concept of getting a suit made, didn't occur to me that this would be something we need to include Certainly, it's not anything the company thought to mention because it really shouldn't be coming up. But Kevin Chev Kevin told me that his only familiarity with the idea of a custom suit being made was from the John Wick movies where they have an ultra thin bulletproof stylish suit and that when chef Kevin used some of our indochino money without telling us to get clothing made, he then took it home and was shooting in. And Basically, it messed up his apartment pretty bad. And the suit looked amazing because they have this really easy process where you visit a stylus at one of their forty showrooms in North American have them take your measurements or you measure at home yourself and shop online at at nocino dot com, you submit your measurements with design choices, and you can relax while your suit gets professionally tailored, which Kevin was able to amazingly pull off those steps correctly. It was the later part of it where the suit looked good and he just assumed that he would be like allowed to shoot it. You know, and I've said about these John Whit movies. They're fun, but they should do more. They should do what I'm doing right now and just say, hey, this doesn't happen. This isn't what Indochino should be expected or anyone should be expected to do. As make suits like this, it's just supposed to be a fun movie. This week, my listeners can get any premium indochino suit for just three seventy nine dollars at indochino dot com when entering handbook at checkout.

But it can take a train driver over a mile to stop even if the driver does see you. Luckily, Raul knew this and he did not drive crossed the tracks and he waited for the train to go by so he's okay. But just to be safe, he is going to be staying at the trade crossing through the end of summer and he's having his birthday party in the car and I can't fit. Be like my friend Raul, and don't try to cross if the signals go if the signal is going, that means the train is coming and you will be hit by a train and you will be smooshed.
