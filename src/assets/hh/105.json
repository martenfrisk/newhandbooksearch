They got made in Germany and and everybody likes them and and so Harry owns a factory now and that's me. I own it. Why pay thirty two dollars for eight pack of blades. It's a half the price at harris. Every the harris you get better shave and I know because I used to be covered in hair and no one trusted me. No more poor quality blades, no pesky Plexy glass cabinet. You don't gotta unlock it. I just ship it to your door so even if you want to use it for something bad, nobody could see Use Amber, that's the promo code you get five dollars off food. That's amazing deal. Men and women that we all need razors in shape willing, they don't suck. And I don't know. We used that language, but today I had to ship to the door. The chief quality is great. The product looks great. You get five dollars off when you use a coupon code and I used to have to live in the woods because I was so hairy. And then I shaved my whole self with the razors that I sell, and I had sex with Super Model, El McPherson as a result. She was in a movie called Sirens maybe. Oh, she was in the edge. Remember that Well, I remember it because I've seen it live in person. She was dealing with the edge of my no meat You know what I'm saying? That's harris dot com. I had to coupon code handbook.

    "line": "Hey, guys. I wanna tell you about Audible. They're offering our listeners a free audiobook of their choice and a free thirty day trial membership. Just go to audible podcast dot com slash handbook and choose from over a hundred and eighty thousand audio programs. Download a title for free and start listening. It's so easy. Go to audible podcast dot com slash handbook. That's audible podcast dot com slash handbook and get started today. So that's the traditional ad read. You guys know when we do an ad. We always like to provide the the anarchist alternative to using that service. That's for anyone out there who rejects currency, refuses to buy into the corporate system. We really respect you guys expect what you're doing. And so here's how to do your own audiobooks if you wanna go the the anarchist route. You just go to the library you look just very casual. You just sort of go right up to the water fountain, maybe drink a lot of water. People say, like, oh, he's just here to get a drink. And then you take some gum and you use the gum to stick the water fountain button down, so it's It's what's pressed down and the water keeps flowing. And that way, they'll hear the water found and think you're still taking a drink. But while it's running, you go over to the book section of the library. And you find the book you like. If if the book isn't there, you go to a different library, you start you know, you do the water fountain thing again, there. So you get the book, you flip through the book, you get a sense of some of the character's voices because you're gonna be reading this out loud. So just flip through the book enough to know like who's a girl and stuff. And then what you do is you take out your phone, and you open a voice memo, you hit record, and this is The important part is you hold the phone up to your ear, like you are having a phone conversation and you read the book into the phone. And if somebody tells you, no phone to the library, then just go into the bathroom and do it there facing a urinal because they're not allowed to stop you from using your phone at a at a urinal. And if you're a girl that you can still do you're you're allowed to use that bathroom as well. It's against a law for them to tell you that you can't. Some reasons to use Audible if you like to go that route instead, do they include, like I said, a hundred and eighty thousand audio programs, free apps for iPhones, iPad, Android, Windows phone, You can listen on pretty much any device. You own your books. There's whisper sync, let you switch switch back and forth between reading the book on a kindle or kindle app and listening to the audio book. So that has its advantages too. I'm not gonna say how you should do it. A book I recommend is modern romance by Azs ansari. Somebody ripped a bunch of the pages out of the library one so you'll have to make up what goes. And it's kinda like pages. I think thirty nine to sixty nine. And I don't know if that's like a joke. I I I mean, I don't know what's in there. So, like, can't really speak to why they did it. But that part is actually pretty easy to make up. If you if if you if if you do it that way, So audible podcast dot com is the other way where you can get a free audio book and a free thirty day trial. It's audible podcast dot com. Slash handbook.",
