We did this Stitcher Premium podcast Master class. And in the last ad, if you heard it, Hayes, in an attempt to sync the show, pretended that we didn't have really great audio equipment. That makes the show sound amazing. I am using the very special, very good mics that we got for the show. And you can expect it to sound not like Hayes's ad, which sounded like friggin doo doo, but actually to sound more like this. Isn't this crystal clear and doesn't every word just make you wanna lean in closer to your headphones or whatever and go, hey, thanks for doing this. So if you're a house subscriber, there's great news for you. With sketchup premium, you no longer have to switch apps to listen to premium content. You can listen To exclusive house shows you love and Stitcher, and they all sound like this. With this great new mic equipment and this great consistent noise that allows you to laugh, have fun with your friends, and go bonkers crazy with enjoyment. So our Shell Hollywood Master Class, the newest such a premium exclusive starring Sean Lemmons and Bang Rajman from Hollywood Handbook. To learn more about Stitcher Premium, go to stitcher premium dot com slash handbook. I'm excited, and I'm having fun, and and Hayes's can't ruin this for me anymore.",
