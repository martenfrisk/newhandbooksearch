He died a little while ago, he spurred himself in the butt and it came clean off, but I've got myself an idea. I'm using all the gold that I find prospected in them their hails to make myself a new golden best friend that's made out of gold. That's right. I am sculpting myself a new friend, the most expensive best friend in the world. And I'm gonna dress him up, and I'll tell you what he's gonna wear. Mac welding, clothes, It's a men's essentials brand that has the same name as me and my best friend, which is a coincidence. It's a brand that believes in smart design, premium fabrics, and simple shopping, and that's why I'm putting it out, my new gold statue that is a life-sized man. Not only do Mac Weldon's underwear, socks, and shirts look good. They perform well too. They have a line of silver underwear that goes great on my gold friend in shirts that are naturally antimicrobial which means they eliminate odor and they keep away bugs like them gold bugs that are trying to get my gold. If you don't like your first pair, you can keep it. And they will still refund you no questions asked so you can put the new pair on, all top of the old one on the statue. I love wear these clothes that I love when all my friends are wearin' them too. And it was so easy to use the website and I'm wearin' one of the shirts right now.

Sean is not gonna be participating in this ad. He has agreed to sort of enter a submersible that it's like a submarine, but it goes all the way the bottom of the ocean and then goes under the ocean floor a little bit. So he is buried under the ocean floor right now because this is kind of a new advertiser for us, and we would really really like to keep them. And so Sean is not gonna be doing this ad, but he has written a few responses to the material in the ad. So I'll just I'll tell you a little bit about about away luggage By using high quality materials like premium German polycarbonate and selling directly to you, away is able to offer resistant lightweight luggage at a much lower price. And Sean's response, I have the sheet here, says, wow. That's that's great. That's amazing. Choose from a variety of colors and four sizes The carry on, the bigger carry on, the medium or the large for extended stays. Sean says, all the colors sound great. I'll take any of the colors that you offer. Next, both sizes of the carry on are able to charge all cell phones, tablets, anything that's powered by a USB cord. Sean says, I actually have in a way suitcase that I love and I use it to charge my luggage and I sorry to charge my devices with my luggage, and I take it on trips. And every away suitcase features a TSA approved combination lock, built into the bag to prevent theft. Sean says, that's really helpful. I use the lock to keep people from stealing my devices. Best of all, they still waste lifetime warranty. If anything breaks, it will fix it or replace it for you for life. And I have it on good authority that Sean has taken some of his toys and books in the submersible, in and away suitcase that is beautifully made and ultra durable.

Not that kind of pissed. Bloody pissed off because I've been cut out. Of the Santa Man movie where are was playing the character of Santa Man? And so now It's a movie that is forty minutes long and it does not feature any main character. They didn't lock my performance as Santa Man. Are all the bloody curse in I was doing wasn't I? They use the Harry's razor to shave me out of the movie and I've gonna say I am impressed and so I did a little research, isn't it? You get. Ari's founders were tired of paying up for razors that were overpriced. And overdesigned. They knew that a great shave doesn't come from gimmicks like vibrating heads. Flex balls. Are andals that look like spaceships, dog day. So they bought a world class blade factory in Germany and started making razors that combine simple clean design with quality durable blades and a fair price. Aries replacement cartridges are just two dollars each. You can get a thirteen dollar value trial set. That comes with everything you need for a close comfortable shave, weighted ergonomic Gandle, fourth blade razor, with a lubricating strip and trimmer blade. Rich lather and shave gel, travel blade cover, and listen to some more show, can redeem their trial set. At ares dot com slash handbook. Make sure you go to ares dot com slash handbook to redeem your offer. And let them know I sent you and told them to put me back in the movie.",

The human but organ has a lot of different things about it that could be interesting, but one of them is When you inject tea, it doesn't exactly make you happy that you turn off your game before you save it. What's he talking about some of the old people in the crowd are saying, here's what I'm talking about. The rapper the game. He is pretty turned off by some of what I've been talking about lately. That's right. I've been saying that he is not a great rapper, and he has been saying to me, don't turn me off. I was about save you. And in the scenario I'm describing, I was about to get beat up, and he could've stopped it. So yeah.

So you get a crank powered iron and so every with every stroke, you have to crank it up for at least, like, fifteen, twenty minutes. So it took it the whole day to iron up this silk dress. Right? And it's a different setting because it's silk. And a lot of people don't know that. So First, you iron it and then you ruin the silk dress. You have to go out and you have to get a different silk dress. So you get your new silk dress, now you know how to iron it, and you keep But then after everything, you also just keep crumpling it back up because it looks like tissue. And so it's finally you've ironed your silk dress for your big event. And you put your silk dress on, and you get in a car, and then legal you have to put and to put on. You have to put on seat belt. Okay? And here's the thing about seat belt. Seap belt is tight. And by design, a seat belt is tight. And what is that? Okay? Because you're wearing your silk dress and you want it to look nice because you're going to a vent. The event that you're going to is maybe who knows? Maybe like an industry event.
