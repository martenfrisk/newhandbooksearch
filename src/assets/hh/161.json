We we we we we are gonna tell you to use Harry's razors just because they have a five blade razor with a softer flex hinge, more comfortable glide and trimmer blade for hard to reach places and a lubricating strip and textured handle for more control when it's wet but why you know, would you use that when you can just Really one by one, yank out every haired your beard and mustache. That's what Santa Man thinks is good and you know those big razor companies that you know that they're worse than Harry's because they wanna put out new models and raise already high prices and all that and Harry's keep their prices the same. But you know what's even cheaper than Harry's is you get a fist full of hair on your face, you pull it's gonna hurt. I mean it's gonna hurt. Harry doesn't hurt. So that's the advantage they have but anyway they're so confident in the quality of their blades to send you a free popular you know, trial said that's what Harry's does. This there's no set for it really. I have a glove that I wear that grips the hair a little bit better. So you know, if you don't if for some reason you can't find a good glove for it or if you just can't take the sort of pain. Then you would use probably the code handbook at check out on Harry's to get a post shave bomb out of the order for free. Go there and you use handbook on on on the Harry site harrys dot com. If you wanna do that instead of instead of pulling your hair out but again I'm what I'm here to tell you is that you've got options and that when a company as a very loyal spokesperson who's very cool who maybe made one or two mistakes you know, just cuts him loose and then he's gonna get out there and be like hey, you know like I got a way to do it. You know you go to harrys dot com and enter the code handbook or what you can do is you lie down, you get your best friend, you guys have a party where you pull each other's hair out of your beards out of your face and that is like a cool like it makes it social if you can schedule that.",
