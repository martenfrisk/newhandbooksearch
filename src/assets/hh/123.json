And I only say that to say that, like, I am still doing this ad despite something that happened recently, which is that we Sean and I got a big award from a big magazine, Los Angeles, weekly magazine. It's like huge. Two years ago, and they sent us an email saying that we could get a plaque. And Adam got the email, and he was like, do you guys want this? And it really seemed like he didn't wanna hang it up in the office. And it just seems like we got his recognition. And and oh, by the way, there are plenty of other plaques hanging up in the office for awards at other shows have gotten they're not like, shows not necessarily like raking in awards recently other than this one. But, you know, there's like one from two thousand twelve for how did this get made? And that's on the wall. But, you know, for us, he's like, oh, like do you go like, do you guys want this or something? Like, it's dumb. When it's like, no. It's not dumb. It was like a big deal. Very there were only podcasts to get that award that year. And and you like, you know, it's like why are these other ones important enough to hang on the wall and not us? And, like, the shoes, the funny shoes that guy did, Why do Sean and I have to share one shoe and yet, like, plenty of other teens get to, like, get their own shoe. Focal and SS's own shoe? Why do they put Fogan S and Kevin Pollock on one shoe like ours is? But I am still doing this ad because I don't care. You know, it's not like I don't let it interfere with doing the ad. It's like Netflix or Podcast. You get access to super ego for writing classics, complete woman and hardcore Game of Thrones. Complete woman is Amanda London Maria Blusucci, and that's funny. And we were funny enough, I guess, to get this award. And I don't know if it's like a like a game, if it's like some kind of because he's definitely making me think about it and I don't know if that's like what he wants. How did this get made a word as a webby? It's like a best web stuff from two thousand twelve. This is just for everything. They awarded a basketball player the same year as we did. And we were like the best podcast out of all of them. How did this get me? It is in the How archives. And so I guess Adam Sachs would love to listen to that show. So he he he should he should definitely subscribe. And there are plenty of other howell originals like the Canon commentaries when they talk about their favorite movies and super ego forgotten classics. And stuff like that. And it's all on your phone for only four ninety nine a month. And, of course, by the way, nothing in this ad about our show. I have no idea whether I know the WTF is on there and comedy Bang Bang and how did this get made. But, like, Hollywood Handbook is not in that same category. Oh, and by the way, there's plenty of space on the wall. There's like almost too much empty space. On this like, maybe you're thinking that, like, there's it's just too crowded. No. There's, like, a huge, huge amount of of open space and stuff to put it up with. It's four ninety nine a month. Use a promo code Hollywood at checkout. It's how dot f m and it's promo code Hollywood and for a one month free trial. And so that'll really be nice for Adam Sachs and, you know, maybe then he would like to do something nice for somebody else. So I'm out in the desert, standing on top of the San Andreas's fault. I have all my tools. I have the drill. I have all the examining technology. I'm ready to go. Who is not there? Cameron.",
