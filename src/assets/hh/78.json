Sean does not really want to do the ad because we've been doing all these loot crate ads, and he has sort of developed this idea that he could do the same sort of product but a little bit better So he has asked me actually to as I read the ad for for Luke Cray to simultaneously read the ad for his product, which It says it's called Sean's loot crate. And I I have one here. I have a Sean's loot crate here. So Luke Cray, the the original Luke Crayed is is is for people who classify themselves as Geek gamers or pop culture nerds. It's a sub a subscription box. And for less than twenty dollars a month, you get six to eight items of gamer and pop culture license gear, apparel collectibles, unique one of a kind items and more. And you can go to lootcrate dot com slash handbook and enter the code handbook to save three dollars on any new subscription. And Sean's loot crate, it says, is also for nerds. It doesn't have a a website yet, but you can just find him, and he'll usually have some in his car, it says. Luke Creek this month has a fantasy theme. They have a lot of fun toys and and stuff from the Game of Thrones franchise and Harry Potter and other the cool stuff like that. Sean's also has a fantasy theme when you look in here. He's got a a a bunch of hair that he says is from from from the hobbit. So I guess this is the hobbit's hair. This says it's it's King Arthur's sword. It looks like kinda like a a paper clip that was unwound to just be, like, straight. So that's a a king Arthur's story. That's kind of fun. And a a a DVD of your highness, the movie your high oh, There's no DVD inside. It's a box. It's a it's a it's a DVD box of your highness. So you can yeah. That's it's totally your decision. You can purchase a loot crate for less than twenty dollars a month and get a discounted subscription at lootcrate dot com slash handbook. Or you can buy Sean's lootcrate, which is also great. I I personally went with Sean's loot crate, but if you get a real loot crate, we could we could trade. It might be fun to trade. So that's lootcrate dot com slash handbook. Or Sean's Sean's car is usually parked at a at a CVS because it's it's it's free.",
