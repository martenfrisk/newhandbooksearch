So if you want to guide me if you want to give me any emotional cues or if there's just someone in my stable of characters who you miss or are excited to meet, please feel free to throw that at me. What what would you like? Mike probably wanna start with hungry guy. Hungry. Yeah. Okay. Why is this feeling? Oh my god. Oh, I'm not going very far, and that was the line I had to say. That's right. Okay. I who's next? Maybe thirsty guy. Oh, god. Why am I? I'm in a rush, and that's what I had to say. That was good. Okay. Two for two. Doctor dentist? Oh, gosh. Way way. It's too uncomfortable and that's a lot. Yeah. It was good. Yeah. There's one more. Maybe like a any superhero. Okay. Sometimes I just forget. So don't kid yourself, guys. There's no such thing as a good excuse for not buckling up. Obviously, each of these characters hungry guy, thirsty guy, doctor dentist and any superhero. We're going through something that many of us have experience. They don't want to put their seat belt on because they're not going very far. They're in a rush. It's too uncomfortable. Sometimes they just forget. If you use any of these excuses or others, you're putting yourself at risk of injury or death. Imagine if hungry guy died. Where would we be? Lost. In twenty seventeen, more than ten thousand people were unbuckled when they were killed in crashes. That could have been doctor dentist that happened too. Think about that. That's fifty one percent of people killed in motor vehicle crashes that were not wearing seatbelts. More than half. No matter what kind of vehicle you drive wearing your seat belt is the best defense in a crash. That goes for when you ride in taxis and use ride sharing vehicles too. Even when you sit in the backseat, you still need to buckle up. I mean, any superhero probably feels invincible a lot of the time. But the fact of the matter is, cops are on the lookout and writing tickets for people not wearing seatbelts so why take the risk? Because even if this superhero, we never decided which one it was. But he did say sometimes I just forget or she. And they might be able to survive a crash. They're a superhero. But cops are on the lookout and writing tickets. So why would you take the risk? In twenty seventeen alone, seat belt saved nearly fifteen thousand lives. That's about a hundred and fifty football teams. So do the smart thing and buckle up every trip day or night.
