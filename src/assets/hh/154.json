    "line": "now hear this. Okay. Now here this festival is coming up October twenty eight through thirtieth in Anaheim, California Fornia, we're performing Me and Sean on the twenty ninth. Lots of other guys WTF spot. Sorry. I I so I just went to Disneyland. Sean had gone before to Disneyland to sort of address his fear of the place in advance of the festival in Anaheim after an incident at Space Mountain in the late seventies or early eighties when he went on the ride and his sweatshirt flew up nipples were exposed from the picture and his nipples were very red, plus he'd had a confrontation with goofy earlier where goofy jokes were funnier than his So he has always hated Disneyland. So he went to face his fear, saw goofy, goofy's dress as a vampire because it's Halloween time. Sean texted me that he was gonna go Van Hell say God goofy and then three hours later, he texted me that I had to pick him up from jail. So I go to Disneyland. Sean is in the jail in the frontier land shooting range. He has like a little laser sensor on him and when you shoot the sensor. It would he was like mechanically compelled. He has all these like mechanical rotors and gears attached to him and his arms when you shoot the sensor, his arms lift up his sweatshirt and they expose his nipples. And then a bunch of ants, I think also mechanical. They made a lot of mechanical noises. But they crawl up his pants and up to his nipples because the ants think his nipples are red hots. It says this on like a plaque. That the ants think that his nipples are red hots. Ferrer pan red hots are candy because they're so red and they're also very very large. And so he's being munched on by these ants and he keeps saying he's like sort of half crying but he's also excited because he keeps saying like this is like this is like Westworld. It's just like Westworld which I guess was kind of true because there was robot stuff and cowboy stuff. But so ultimately I have to give goofy a hug to get Sean out of the Frontierland shooting range and Sean has been very pissy ever since to me also I think because I saw him in that possession, it makes he was embarrassed. And he had to cut the nipples out of the he wears this this Eddie George Jersey to watch football and he had to cut the nipples out because the mesh was scratching his nipples. And so the show the show may not happen. But look, check the website at now here this fast dot com and use the code handbook to get good tickets.",
