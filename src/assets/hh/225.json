    "line": "okay. Well, what do you know? The arms race continues. For long time listeners, I've been engaged in kind of a battle with Squarespace. They kinda ripped off my idea which was I had this cool thing where you could build your own website and it was kind of a a a plug in thing on a on a e s b n dot com. Where you could get, you know, whatever you want. Website wise, you could look at a or sorry, you could build baseball website with all kinds of articles or soccer or anything. But they're like a freaking Jason in those horror movies where they just won't go away. And here they are slashing at me again. They are making it even easier to turn your idea into unique website. Showcase your work, blubber published content, sell product services of all kinds in just a few clicks. So all these were initially my ideas and I want I have a testimony here from Kevin. Chef Kevin is here. Say, hey, chef Kevin.",

    "line": "So chef Kevin is gonna tell you So what they're saying What Squarespace is saying Okay. Sell products and services, just a few clicks, customize everything from look and feel to settings and products using templates created by world class designers and they're saying that as if that's so great, but I would argue that my site now is even better. I've actually abandoned e s b n dot com due to some legal issues that came up with the last set of ads that we did but we don't even wanna be involved with them anymore. And the new thing I'm doing is even better and even more great. And I think will help more people probably than Squarespace. Don't you agree, Kevin? A hundred percent. So my new website is called earwolf dot com and it's so so cool and you can go in there and build your own website on there way easier than Squarespace. Because what you have to do with Squarespace is have an idea, pick out what it looks like put all your stuff on. But mine is better because you can build this website where you're listening you know, clearing the garbage or you're listening to -- Jeff Garland. Garland. Right? And I've sort of, you know, done some of the legwork for you where there's a template there. They will have a picture of the guests on the episode and then you can do this fun thing where you build it by clicking and listening and ordering all the merchandise. So to me that's so much better than Squarespace, which is at squarespace dot com. You could go there for a free trial I don't know why you would when you could go to earwolf dot com chef Kevin. I mean talk about some of the stuff you've seen on there and and the websites you've built.",

Anyway, beautiful templates created by world class designer, Squarespace makes it easy to turn your idea to a new and unique website, which is great. That's great. And you can showcase your work and blog or publish content, sell products, and service of all kinds of just a few clicks. You can customize everything from look and feel the settings and product, all optimized for mobile right out of the box. Go ahead. Do that. But when you're doing it, just be aware Don't get too comfortable because I am working on another site and it's gonna be big when I announce it this site is huge and it's gonna be even more of a threat to square space because guess what? It's got space in it and I'll give you a hit. It's my space. And it really is my space. This can be mine because from my understanding, that site is pretty cheap right now. And then you'll be building and customizing a lot of stuff on there, promote your band, Listen to some Dane Cook shows. Do whatever you want on there. Squarespace got that. I doubt it. There's nothing to install patch or upgrade ever. That's not gonna be true on my space, obviously. You will have to patch a lot. If you have a question, Squarespace's award winning twenty four seven customer support is there to help. Now we're gonna have that too when I do my space.

I know your parents used to tell you not to play with your food but they're not here right now and we're gonna make this fun. So Blue Apron's this meal kit delivery service is probably the leading one in the US. You know what? Strike that probably. It is the leading meal kit delivery in the serve service in the US at the time of me recording this at, of course, that could always change. It delivers fresh pre portioned ingredients and step by step recipes that can be cooked under forty five minutes right to your door. And people know about it but they don't always know about the types of meals you can eat when you cook a blue apron and they also don't know you don't have to cook this stuff. What you can do is invent a sport that instead of using like a bat and a ball and bases. You're gonna use some of these foods. So for instance, Kevin's inventing all these really fun games. That help you stay in shape and have a blast with your buddies and also you get bragging rights when you win. Kevin, talk about strip steaks with potatoes and spicy Maple colored greens game that you love.",

It's the most bad ass game in the universe in terms of all the warships that you can build, but we did actually tell you guys about our own ships and ask you to please not mess them up. Didn't we? And what did you do? I don't know which one it was. But somebody did something pretty nasty to one of my ships. And it was my good best ship, and you did get in there and do something nasty. So what you're supposed to do on the game, thank you, is you get to command a massive naval fleet with four class ships from over eight nations, fighting it strategically designed environments. What you're not supposed to do It's climb on the deck of my ship and blow your nose in the flag. Disgusting. And if I find out who it was, oh, baby. Already every match is a unique experience filled with endless hours of strategy, tactical gameplay and pulse pounding naval combat action. Oh, well, it's gonna be an even more unique experience if I find out who blew their nose in my flag. World of warships brings players endless hours strategy, tactical gameplay and pulse pounding, naval combat. So when you freaking get in with me, here's what I'll do. Start strategizing. Right? I'm doing my tactical gameplay. Your pulse is pounding from the naval combat action. And then all of a sudden, if I find out you're the one who climb up the pole and then freaking blew your whole nose on my whole flag and coughed on there too and did look like even spittle, hawk to loogie? A loogie and dumped out a hole, soda on the deck? If I find that, that's you. Oh, baby. What I do is just freaking use my ship to get you. Think about that. It really is the perfect balance of action and strategy now, isn't it? Download world of warships free today at command warships dot com to begin your naval adventure. And one more thing, I've changed the way my ship looks. So you're not gonna know if you're even dealing with me until it's too late when I use my ship to get you. So make sure you enter the code hollywood eighteen h o l l y w o o d eighteen in all caps. The numbers are not capitalized of course because that will just generate a symbol of some kind. So Hollywood's all cap. Then you type eighteen. It's all one word and the reason we do that is to remind you that even though you're on international waters when you're on a ship, you should still honor the law of the land in terms of the age of consent. So when you use that code, you get a free premium ship, Aurora, and a pile of in game currency to jump start your epic world war two naval experience. Just download world of warships today, command warships dot com. Start playing today.",

Then one of the showers turns off so I go, okay, this person's gonna get out of the shower soon. So I walk over and I post up in front of the shower. Drew Tarver. Oh, don't worry, why? And I'm standing there outside his fucking shower, like a total creep. And and he and and so I, of course, don't explain what's It's like And and I'm thinking like if the roles were reversed and I opened door to someone's outside the shower, I would never think oh, the showers must be full and he was waiting because that's never happened there. So he just sees me waiting outside and I am kinda happy with what my reaction was, which is I see a space and I just go perfect. Walk into the shower and just start up. But, like, he must think I'm very strange and I don't blame him. Perfect. And that was it. So that happened at the gym and I hope to see you there. I've been there a little more lately.",

This one's in Hollywood. The network is the nectar, baby. Bye. Hollywood Handbook. Okay. Alright. Very funny. So world of warships. Really fun game. Or it used to be for me, for what happened is, basically, so I warned you guys not to mess up my ship again, and I did say that was gonna catch whoever did it. And basically, I wasn't able to. And basically, my ship is even more messed up now. And now I'm wondering who knows because I changed the way it looked so that you wouldn't know who it was. And what I did to change the way it looked, was basically I changed what was on it. And so I changed the name and I changed what was on it and made it look different. And, basically, I thought that would work. And somebody probably either saw me doing it or was sneaky and told. Because now I really am just like, what am I supposed to do? Because somebody dumped out a bunch of cigarette butts of jelly beans all over the deck and I slipped, and then I landed in yucky cigarette butts. Don't smoke. So you're looking for ways to engage in a little friendly competition? Well, try to keep it friendly. And don't jump jump jelly beans everywhere. I can't have that stuff. You know what Sugar does to me? Makes me act crazy. You wanna captain some of the greatest world warships of War War two and World of Warships. Go ahead. It's free to play historical online combat game for war gaming. You know, download for free at command warships dot com and begin your naval adventure. All that stuff sounds so fun. And then when you're doing it, If you see my ship, just leave. I'm not trying to have a fight with anyone. I don't care anymore. I just want it to be clean. I mean, cleaning it all day. And it stinks. All the jellybeans were black licorice. You ever have that flavor? It sucks. It makes your teeth look bad too. I got enough problems with that. You know what happened when I tried doing Visaline? I put it on wrong. And you know what happened to me then? It hurt my whole mouth. So, you know, just leave my ship alone, go on, do tactical strategy with each other, have the fight, if you see a ship that and I'll tell you what it looks like now. Because now I'm not gonna change it again because obviously that doesn't work. So tell you what it looks like now and you could just know. It's got Johnny Nutron on it.
