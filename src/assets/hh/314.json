    "line": "hey, guys. It's Hayes. Support for today's show comes from I'm listening, a new podcast about the Hit nineties TV show, Fraser. Every episode explores a theme from the show including the most bizarre from reading fan fiction to exploring Kelsey Graham's autobiography, host and TV fan Anita Flores. Therappies is the fandom surrounding this iconic TV show. I, of course, I'm a huge fan of Fraser. I am excited to listen to this show. It gets into all of your favorite episodes. Fraser's new friend, Fraser's birthday, Fraser on the moon, Frazier plays on the computer. Fraser does Brazil. Fraser goes on master chef. Fraser Beaucelyn Boyle. Fraser rolls down a hill in trash can. Fraser gets wet. Fraser fights, Queen Neffertiti. Fraser's haunted house. Fraser Fraser learns to bake, Frazier falls down, Fraser's Universal Studios vacation, Fraser's new diary, Fraser's adventure, Fraser meets the San Diego padres, Frazier eats pasta, and yes, Fraser is captured and taken to the dog pound. It's a laugh out loud, weirdly deep exploration into effects of pop culture. You can find I'm listening, a Fraser fan podcast on all podcast platforms, and at listening podcast dot com. Hospital with Lewis, Lewis, comma Joe. Lewis, Joe, and we are -- Come in kids. --",

So last time I talked to you, I had found moriarty's computer open to some stuff and I was kind of going hey, some of this stuff looks a little weird. Obviously, Moriarty is my step dad. Do, you know, do I tell my mom? He's looking at some Things that are off the beaten path, so to say. Anyway, so maybe I shouldn't have done it. I told my mom, you know, I said, hey, I think you should know about this. I may have been out of line, maybe not my place but I said you should know, hey, this is what I saw, do with it what you will. Maybe you already are aware, maybe this is what you guys are into. None of my business but just I've got this info now you have it. So she talks to Moriarty And he said that it was a virus that was on his computer. So, okay, so She doesn't know. That's what I see right away. We we we a virus. That ain't no damn virus. Or or here you go. If it is, you know how you get it? By looking for that stuff. It was not bad stuff. I mean it wasn't illegal but it's it was like fee and stuff. Not my thing. Anyway, so I I figure whatever. She's buying it he's all set. They let them go do their thing. I did my part. Maybe I did too much. I'm going to bed last night thinking it's all behind me. And what do you think I found under my pillow? A razor blade, left by moriarty. Well, lucky for me it wasn't a Harry's razor blade. So it was dull and low quality and it didn't cut me a bit. Humans have been shaving for thousands of years, but the secret to a great shape hasn't changed much. That's why Harry's doesn't overcharge you to add gimmicky features to their razors. This one moriarty left me had all kinds of features it didn't need and that's why ultimately it was safe and I'm glad that he messed up. You know, I think when I'm shaving, I don't want that stuff. I want a Harry's one. If he had left to Harry's, I'd be in trouble because they are so sharp and good. But you know, I use them Harry's ones just for shaving and it makes me so clean and nice and Harry's is a return to the essential quality durable blades at a fair price just two dollars per blade. They cut out the middle man manufacturing blades in their German blade factory which has been honing precision blades for a century and really and I got to say in Moriardi's defense.",

Plain's friggin. Suck to be on, and you can't get comfortable. And the other neck pillows, friggin suck. The ones that look like a you and you put behind your head and people freaking think that they're gonna be able to tuck their head in their shoulder, but you never can quite get it right and you gotta lean back too much. Yeah, turtle don't do that. Turtle is looking like a turtleneck and put on your neck and make you belong to the turtle club which at some airports, I can't say which ones, you do get special perks if you're in the turtle club and you get to go and hang out with the other members, the turtle club and you get to eat fresh lettuce. But That's not really that important. What's really important is as a podcast listener, I know you're flying alone. You're traveling alone and it's for business. Let's face it. It is not for any kind of personal pleasurable social experience. It is for business and it is for a job that you loathed and that is who I'm here to talk to. You don't have to feel weird putting your head on a stranger's shoulder to go to sleep. Now you've got turtle. I'm so pumped to wear the turtle when I fly back for Thanksgiving to see my family. Oh, I'm not looking forward to the trip but I am looking forward to putting the turtle on. I don't know, you know I used to always be like, well, I guess I gotta get a window seat. Maybe I could put my head up against the sort of window wall, but that sucks too. They send me two turtles, one's sort of softer and one is more structured. My wife likes the softer one and I like the structured one. A win. Anyway, the patented design fits any neck jaw and shoulder shape. It's proven to work over a million sold in eleven thousand reviews The turtle pillow is the most reviewed travel pillow on Amazon. The secret is the internal support structure which flexes to support your head and keeps you upright. It is turtles business to solve all your travel hass with their range of innovative travel accessories for the new Pillow plus to from the new pillow plus to packing pods and a collection of award winning compression socks available in loads of fun designs. I I haven't flown with it yet but it's comfy as heck and sometimes I've been considering sleeping with it on just when I'm like watching TV and stuff. Maybe I'll do it. Maybe for the next ad, I'll say if that worked out for me. Anyway, flying can be comfortable. Thanks to Turtle. Right now you can get twenty percent off.
