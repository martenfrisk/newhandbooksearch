Sure it's funny for the viewers but it's not always fun for the person who's thinks they're in a commercial for a new Jeff Gold Bloom, and then also thinks they hurt Jeff Gold Bloom by spraying him with it. So I'm the first to admit yes. I've been upset about this sort of thing but I don't think that all these guys being pissed about fake gamer girls should be able to forbid this game which you said is sexy fun and has some positive relationship elements. From coming in the United States, especially for a volleyball enthusiast like me.
