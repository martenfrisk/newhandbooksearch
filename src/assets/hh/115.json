And she was very well behaved for most of it during the liturgy, the benediction, the lesson, but during the songs, we would start to sing the songs about angels and Heaven. And she would sing take me to church. But she would sing a different version. I guess it's sort of a song parody version called I am at the church. I think it was a because she would do it in kind of a weird al voice where she would go. Exactly. I'm at the church. I'm worshiped like a frong she's, like, frog during all the things.

He tried to pronounce the name of that funny fish that they have there and got arrested for doing it in sort of a rude way. So he is still there. We're also not at the Eyewolf studio today.

Is it gonna be something like the movie the gift where he has access as a groundskeeper to a much nicer house and has let himself in while the family is out of town perhaps on holiday break and hosts a nice dinner for me at the house to pretend that he's very successful. I thought it could be something like that. It's obviously not because this place is much too bad to to to pose as a normal house.",
