And I wonder if I did I hit something? I hit a button? And the truth about that is these are called ads, the little middle parts of the show that are that are short and about different stuff are the ads. And what they do is they help the podcast or keep making the show. It's like it's like food for the show. And the company that books the ads for the show is called Midroll. They're like our they like our feeders. They're like a a lunch lady. And Midroll helps us out, and they also take good care of our advertisers. And podcast ads work. Sixty seven percent of Hollywood Handbook listeners bought a product they heard about on a podcast cast. And it I think it was ours. I think I remember hearing them say it it was ours that they heard about the product on. And so you can check out their website at mid roll dot com slash h h and then click contact to let them know you're interested in advertising on Hollywood Handbook. You can be a product yourself, as I think what that's saying. And they also represent another a bunch of other great shows like how did this get made in Comedy Bang Bang.
