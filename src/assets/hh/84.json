Some of you know I am living in the walls of the earwolf studio and that has its perks. And one of them is I could get my hands on the ad copy after hours and get into the system and so if Sean and Hayes too busy to ask me to do an ad, I can always do it. So I'm happy that my old lady threw me out. Because it's gives me a better chance to do my job and here goes nothing. Project work is normal in the entertainment industry, but if you wanna buy a house that could prevent you from getting a traditional mortgage. Luckily, there's a lender that understands the industry.
