    "line": "Bingbong, it's ad time, everybody, you know the Klendog only brings you the hottest ads that absolutely help fund the podcast. There's no substitute for the ads that I read. And if you're not listening to them, then you are going to be feeling left out at the water cooler. Come Monday. Got my hush puppies on. I guess I never was one forklift or rock and roll. That's the lyric from Come Monday by Jimmy Buffet. I'm gonna tell you a little bit about cleaning up your remote control clutter with control center by Cavo. Control center simplifies your home theater. So you can control everything connected to your TV with one easy to use remote with voice control. Plug in your streamer sound system cable or satellite even your game console and control center does it all. Now it's not gonna surprise anybody here to learn that. No. Cabo's not the only control center on the market. I made one to not here to say which one's better. Obviously, Cabo is paying for the ad. I'm not gonna say mine is better. Mine is called Cabron. And it is different. It's not for stuff connected to your TV that I, obviously, is good. Sometimes you will struggle with TV thing. Minus for stuff connected to your lawnmower. So if you have like a walkman that you listen to while you're doing your lawnmower, my control center Caborone would be able to do that too. I'll tell you more about Cavo. Don't wait time fiddling with different remotes or weeding through messy search results to get to the content you want. So full disclosure for me. With cup run, you do have to waste time fiddling with different remotes. It comes I don't know how many remotes you use for your lawnmower right now, but my system comes with Sixteen or seventeen different remotes depending on the package you get and a lot of them don't do anything at present, but they're there as backups because we are planning to roll out more functions in the coming decade. Anyway, with Cavo, there's one universal voice remote that controls it all. So you just say what you wanna watch and let control center handle the rest. Again, I'm not a competitor for anything like that. There's no universal voice remote In fact, if you do speak while using the remote, it will stop working. It will just shut down as a safety measure because really you shouldn't be talking while you mow the lawn. There's spinning blades. It's dangerous. Just don't even mess with it. For Cavo, you can enjoy every second of couch time and easily switch between content without moving to muscle. Obviously, you can't do that with Cabron. Even if you have a riding lawnmower, you are moving muscles just to steer and stuff, And that's not what I have. I have an old fashioned push kind and I have a walkman that I listen to. Well, I do it and my seventeen remotes operate both at the same time. Let control center take your at home entertainment experience from stressful to simple. I hate to keep doing I hate to keep counterpoint backing up and talking about mine, it's the opposite. I go from simple to stressful, they want you to enjoy what you want when you want with ease. I want you to get your grass short and and listen to music. My personal experience using control center, I have not used it yet. I don't know if I will get in trouble for saying that. I I do think it sounds really cool. It sounds certainly better than mine. I would love to get on the horn with them and talk about some of the technology they have and see if I could use it for. Cab roam because I currently am unable to use my lawnmower or my walkman just because of the way one of the remotes doesn't have batteries and I don't know which one it is. But anyway, I I do know that it is a very cool system, Kavo, and that they have a great website up that's easy to use so you can get started if you go to c a a v o dot com cavo dot com is a great website that I have been to and it is laid out in a cool simple way. There also available at Best Buy. You know I'm part of the Geek Squad. Why wouldn't I be? So shop now and get forty percent off control center with promo code The Boys. That's forty percent. That's huge. Forty percent off control center with promo code, the boys. That's fifty nine ninety five, forty percent off regular pricing of ninety nine ninety five. Service plan is required first forty five days are free. Control center is available at c a a v o dot com and Best Buy, control center by Cavo. One remote that does it all. And again, mine Cabron is seventeen remotes that doesn't do. And they don't it currently doesn't do anything.",

    "line": "Hey, guys. Time to take another break from the Hollywood tips that we serve up on Hollywood Handbook, and listen to me read in ad for one of the people that has paid some money so that we will talk about their product to you, the listeners. Well, it's brilliant earth again, the global leader in ethically sourced fine jewelry and you know what that means you can create your own custom engagement ring, and we are still plotting out Kevin's engagement to his girlfriend, Leah. These are two real people that we know, and we talk about them getting engaged, they're in an actual relationship. And so that's something that we've elected to be the angle for these ads. So, obviously, if you listen last week, we did suggest some ways that Kevin could design his engagement ring and do the proposal. None of those worked out. We're going back to the drawing board and the great people at Brilliant Earth are so easy to work with. They have right on their website a variety of ethically sourced diamonds, gemstones, metal types and settings for you to choose from if, you know, the brilliant earth dot com is the website to go and do that and what Kevin has cooked up. I was just you know, did a spitball session with him to see what he's into. He's chef Kevin, what does he love. He said that something very special to him is Leah thinks his personality is extremely similar to Yogi Bear's friend boo boo from the Yogi Bear movie. If you remember boo boo is kind of wimp. And he's sort of somebody's like, yo yee. And that is how Kevin sees himself So we are working with the good people at brilliant Earth to design a ring that looks like a golden picnic basket and the rubies are jelly inside jelly sandwiches and the bread is a friggin other kind of stone. So basically, Leah would have a ring that looked like a picnic basket and then she could open up and take out little jewel jelly sandwiches and he is hoping that that will make her accept this, his third proposal. Anyway, Brilliant Earth offers wedding rings vintage pieces and many other handcrafted jewelry items with exclusive unique designs. You can't find anywhere else. They're passionate about cultivating a more transparent sustainable and compassionate jewelry industry. They go above and beyond the current industry standards to offer beyond conflict free diamonds along with fine jewelry crafted from recycled precious materials, and just to jump out again, I guess what Kevin's gonna do is rent out a theater and have them play that Yogi bear movie. It's interesting to me because I feel like the cartoon is so much more iconic than the movie, but I guess I'm older than him. And at the moment where, I guess, there's a scene in the movie where Boo boo gets stung on the butt by a bunch of bee he sits on a bee hive and the bee sting his butt, and he goes, now I got a boo boo on my bum bum. And that is to Kevin the funniest part. And I guess when the bees are stinging his butt, he's gonna get down on one knee, And then he's going to say, now I have a boo boo on my bum bum. At the same time they do in the movie, and then go, no, wait. I just checked again the boo boo's on my heart because I am not married to you yet. And could you fix that boo boo and put a band aid on it? The band aid is your love, and then you can show the picnic basket ring I described earlier. They even donate five percent of their profits to help build a brighter future. This is brilliant Earth in communities impacted by the jewelry industry. Outstanding and highly personalized customer service is the hallmark of the brilliant earth shopping experience to make your brilliant earth purchasing experience as stress free as possible They offer free shipping and returns on all US, UK, and Canadian orders. And I am going to be busting in playing the ranger but I'll be like an usher and I'll be telling them they gotta get out of there and I I guess pretending to arrest them And then I, like, marched them to a jail cell that has, like, a romantic dinner set up and brilliant earth. Will provide the candle holders, which will be made of precious jewels. I don't have to go into the names of all the jewels. Obviously, I know more than just rubies and gold.

It's a CBS all access show and you can join the fight by watching the new season, now streaming exclusively on CBS all access. I'm Sean Clements. I'm telling you about this show on this streaming platform. Tune in to see if Diane Lockhart will lead the resistance in a new Post factual world where the lawyers with the best stories triumph over the lawyers with the best facts. Sound familiar? Now an honor the CBS All Access Show. The Good Fight, I am going to tell you guys about one good fight I have had with my cohost Hayes. Who's not here every time I read an ad for them. So one fight that we had was when we were in Chicago, we were on our way running a little bit late actually to get to the theater for Soundcheck to do our show at that onion festival. And we were walking and we were walking by this coffee place that had a specific kind of coffee that I like. And we had already called a a car service to come pick us up, one of the big apps. And Hayes had done it on his phone and I said, sorry, do I have time to just stop in for coffee real quick and he in a tone that I did not like went, no, you don't. And I was like, f hey, f u, you know? Because I just didn't like he sort of scoffed. And then I got in the car with him, and we went all the way to the theater, and then I walked out to get a coffee Right next to the theater and I really didn't like it. It wasn't very good. And I knew that I could have had that other one. We were about to do these two shows in front of a big group of people that I was pretty nervous about and little things like having the coffee I want make me feel more comfortable before, something like that. And so I was mad at him and being snippy and I was on, like, day eight of, like, a ten day course of prednisone, which was to treat acute pharyngitis. Also something that I you know, I was like, I have to talk to all these people in my throat is messed up, but it was making me not sleep well. I was irritable and and sweaty. And anyway, that's a really good fight that we had where I was like f u don't say that to me that we don't have enough time and he said, well, I called the car. The car was gonna leave in two minutes. We were running late to the theater already. And I said, but I didn't get the coffee. I I wanted And he said he didn't realize that was so important to me. Anyway, it's all fine now and that's a good fight, but there's even better ones on the show The Good Fight on CBS All Act. As Christine Buranski's back as the venerable Diane Lockhart along with Cush jumbo, Rose Leslie, and audra McDonald. Del Roy Lindo delivers another camp misperformance while or Michael Sheen shakes up the screen as infamous lawyer, Roland Blum. New characters, new ripped off the headlines story lines, new dynamic cast. Well, no. I mean, not all of them are new. Some of them you know and you like already. Dynamic casted so much more. This season the standard playbook goes out the window. So if you're tuning in for the standard playbook, it's there but it's not being treated that nicely because it's going out the window. Talk about how stacked the cast is. It says, well, how about Christine Buransky, Kush jumbo, Rose Leslie, Sarah McDonald, and Delroy Lindo, delivering another Canvas performance with actor Michael Sheen shaking up the screen. Anyway, thanks for listening to my good fight that I had with Hayes. You can join the fight by heading over to c b s dot com slash handbook to redeem your free trial of CBS All Access to watch the new season now streaming exclusively on CBS All Access, that c b s dot com slash handbook to redeem your free trial of c b s all access. And stay tuned to this show as we continue to bring the podcast.",

I'm screaming. I can't stop screaming because it's back. So I promised, I will tell you about a good fight I had with my cohost Hayes every time I read the good fight ad copy. This one was worse. I was out of town. Hayes was recording an episode that I wasn't there for, but I had scheduled to call in for a bit that I had planned to do kinda just a stupid bit, but I had a little joke I wanna do when I was gonna call into the show. I Prepare for it was texting saying I'm ready to call. They were like we're recording then all of a sudden the show was over. I had not in the opportunity to call in or they hadn't called me. I was very snippy and nasty about it and was, like, why didn't you just call me, like, what's going on? The timeline didn't make sense to me because the text I'd received was that, like, they were recording, but then all of a sudden they were done. And I felt left out in a way or something like I wasn't part of my own show and and I don't know, jealous. But I But I really was out of line and and I sent Brett a text that was sort of snippy and totally uncalled for and later apologized to him. And Hayes did call me and sort of read me the riot act about my behavior so that was another good fight we had. And if you like good fights, watch the good fight.
