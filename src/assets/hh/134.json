I wanna tell you about nudist colony t shirts at nudist colony dot c o We used to call them Nuty Street Colonel of New York t shirts, so people didn't get confused because the nudist colony is for no t shirts. T shirts against the rules. So he said let's call them Nuty Street Colonel of New York t shirts, and it'll spelled the same, nobody will freak out. Well, now the actual Nuttty Street Colonel of New York is extremely pissed at us. I didn't even know he was real, but he says he's gonna send the whole army to beat us up for using his name about the t shirts. So we said, hey, why don't you take some of these t shirts? Because we wear them. We have some. And they're great. They cost like a hundred bucks at the store, but you get them for thirty bucks a month. You sign up, they send you different kinds, and you get to see your mailman when he comes to bring you the mail. We said why you do that? That's a so maybe you will not be so mad. Well, it turns out the ninety street colonel, New York hates t shirts. He likes green jackets with stars on them, and that's it. He said. And his mailman just died recently so that got an even more upset he thought we were making fun of it. But anyway, just go to nudist colony dot c o and get the t shirts and not dot com. There's no m. The m is for the m looks tasty. I wanna eat it, but first I gotta delete it. Because there isn't one.",

And we actually got a couple emails from army guys being like, Thank you so much. Like that guy's been pissing me off for so long. Finally, somebody showed him what's what by stealing his name and using it for a t shirt company. But then another Army guy emailed us to say that he was friends with the Nuttty Street Journal of New York and the guy actually does have a lot of friends in the Army. But it kind of seemed like that was the Neddy Street Journal New York emailing. So we asked him to Skype with us And he said okay. It took a really long time and that's it okay. And then the video feed was just a still image of Daman Wayens in major pain. And he said it was frozen and that he couldn't hear us. But he was responding to what we were saying, but he said he couldn't hear. So anyway, nudist colony dot c o t shirts are so nice.
