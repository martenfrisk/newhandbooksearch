I wanna tell you about the first movie to advertise on our show, which is finally someone being smart because people listen to our show are famous for loving the movies. The movie is called two step, and we're gonna do sort of a sponsored teaser freezer of of the movie. It's an intense Texas thriller. It's a New York Times critics pick from writer director Alex r Johnson, has a hundred percent fresh rating from rotten tomatoes. Steven Holden calls a a nasty, flawlessly acted little gem that goes deep inside its character, Sykes, and he's from the New York Times. But what you should really listen to is what I think, because I'm gonna watch the teaser. I don't wanna give away because it's sponsored. Sometimes we give away spoilers of the movies and I don't wanna give away any spoilers. The the the teaser is available online and the movie's builder available to rent on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, and Demand Xbox, Dish Network, and more. But so for now, I'm gonna watch the teaser and talk about it in real time, but I don't want to spoil anything. So the sound I'm gonna leave the sound off. So you won't hear the sound, but you can hear me watching the trailer and talking about the trailer and thinking about it and telling you how it is. And then you can watch it yourself if you want. So let me play. Trevor's media. Okay? And a horse, a couple of horse. I noticed that. There's the guy He's up to something. I know that. Okay. Oh, okay. And he's there. He goes. Okay. And this part's a little confusing because you do see the guy, but you don't his is that his horse? He's not looking at it when he and he would if it were his, would he look at his own horse? And he's looking at something else. There's another guy. He's talking. I don't know about what I can't hear either, but he looks pissed. Bad guy. Looks like bad guy. Now he's going. He's now he's got the money. And it's just cutting around. So it's hard to keep up because of the the sound. Oh, hello, nurse. She's not a nurse. Just like a she looks good. Nice. Looking lady talking on the phone, I guess. The guy, you see his teeth And I'm trying I'm trying to remember the stuff I've already seen and kinda put it's hard when I'm talking about it too at the same time. And I just missed a big part, I think, with the police. Oh, that was a punch. I know oh, man. Would hate to have a punch like that. To me, And so there's a battle happening. Just a two a two guy battle. There's the money again, but he doesn't have it anymore. But was that the first guy? Says okay. Well, that's it. Coming soon, pixels. It says pixels. Oh, man. It was Pixel's teaser. Well, that's good. That's actually good because I didn't wanna say, but I was confused. Watching it. So I will say that I that I didn't necessarily think was good, but I do think you should watch two step on iTunes. Look up two step by Alex r Johnson, and only watch pixels later if you if you want to yourself and try it before you buy it.",

And so it's very very cold, but I'm gonna try to get through the ad. So Internet dot b s is simple and very low on the upsell and they don't make you through a bunch of products. You don't wanna you don't want just to get to your domain name. And they're consistently the best price registrar in the market. And they offer a large range of domain name choices. It's so cold. Anyway, they got a bunch of choices, and they also give customers free private WHOIS free web forwarding. You know what I wish I had? Like a winter hat. Like, that would be perfect because, like, you actually lose and this is actually a fact science wise that like, ninety nine percent of your body heat gets lost through your head. And that's why your toes getting them so fast because they're not actually losing heat. They just shut off. Anyway, they got free email forwarding and free DNS management. And internet dot b s is easy to use. It's a customer a portal that gives you total control management of your domains, and it's like a scarf would be good for me. Like, even though that's not your head, but it's, like, the neck part of your head and that could be helpful. Oh, or hot cocoa. Anyway, internet dot b s is running a promotion on dot biz domain.

It is it was two steps. The two step trailer, which is what I thought because it was it said New York Times critics pick, and it said Alex r Johnson, I thought that's not pixels. That's two step. But somebody wrote pixels on my screen, then I just I guess I just noticed it as the trailer was ending. And I think the message of someone writing pixels on my computer screen is, like, this is what the is being on the screen is pixels, like, just for me to remember, I think. And I asked Sean I assume Sean did this because I know Sean learned about that recently. And he said he didn't do it, but he also described the handwriting and the color of the marker and stuff before I even told him what it was. Like he said, I didn't write the pencil on your screen in yellow three d letters where the s is made of two pac man's. And so I was like, I didn't even tell you that. So how did you even know that's what it was? But he is right that if somewhere we're gonna write pixels, it probably would be made of pac man. So I actually don't know. But you gotta watch two snippets on iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, in demand, Xbox, Dish Network, and and more. So look up what else it's on. It's it's a Texas crime noir.",
