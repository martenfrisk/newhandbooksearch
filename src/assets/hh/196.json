And it's, you know, a new idea they have where it's gonna freaking do podcasts. You know, it's like we're setting up enough podcasts. So anyway, this one's new and it's available now and I think you're really gonna love it. Jessica Mckenna and Zach Reno, like the, you know, biggest little city in Nevada. They're two of the funniest people out there, and they're also two of the most musical people. They made this thing called off book It's an improvised musical podcast. I don't know where they got the idea. Maybe I had just Hollywood Handbook a while ago, and we did a good musical about politics. But regardless of how they came up with it, they have had these guests, Larry Sempervisor, Paul, Tonga, Mary Hall and all. I mean, whatever. So they have not yet invited yours truly, mister Shank Lemmons. To the show, but I think that's about to change when they hear this little number that I've decided to drop into the Adread. Yes. Yes. Good. Good. And, yes, little more. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Shit. Mhmm. But fuck. Fuck. Start it over. Start it over. Start it over. Start it over? Maybe, oh, maybe I'll try wrapping it. Yo. Fuck. I'm not Okay. Three, two, one. Oh, drop them easy? You mess up, Sam. That's the wrong track.",

I'm good at songs. I'm good at rep and singing. But nobody's gonna buy the cow. That's why I don't fuck on the first date and that's why I don't give them the song in the ad. Jessica came on our show in November to help us make good funny election video. Oh, I mentioned that already, but it's in the copy. You might know or care and Comedy Bang Bang, your boy Troy Power Will's Beth. Check it out. The show's pure unadulterated musical joy in a podcast. So subscribe to off book and I would have been able to do a good job, good song. If they have me on, I kill it. But I'm busy. I might not have I might scheduling. It might not work out. But they probably want me. They know what I can do. I don't gotta show it in an ad. I didn't mess up. I did good. I had a couple good ideas for a song. The rapping part was good but would have been even better if I had not been taking the lesson of nobody wants a cow if the milk's free. Cows, you know, don't just give you their milk. You gotta fucking earn it. That's why I don't give it up. I don't give a woman full pleasure on on the first day. I always hold some back. I don't want her to get addicted to it right away. And so that's why I do sort of ease in and only do a couple of my best moves. Just like I did in this ad, I only did one or two of my moves, the saying, yo, before I wrap and then starting this order to start to cry. So subscribe off book from earwulffins to your Apple Podcasts wherever you you wanna listen. So of course, you know, on the set of wild things, we're filming the famous scene. You know the one. It's me, it's Denise. Richard. And it's Neve. Schumann. And we're getting into it. We're getting hot. Heavy. And I start to go You know, he You don't look much like your audition tape.",
