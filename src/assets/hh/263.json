I remember years ago, John, I worked on a show called thirty rock. I was a background actor. Wow. I played one of the writers in the room. A little bit foreshadowing of what my life would be. And Lonni Ross had a concept to do a web series that could be promoted during the show about like Lonnie's adventures. He'd be on a big poverty tour and he'd go with two of the writers. And so as myself, Anthony Tamanick, we're gonna be the two writers. And he would be, like, getting into a jam, like, almost getting into bar fight, and then the writers would write some good idea and slide it to him on a cocktail napkin, and then he'd do one of his impressions, maybe Seinfeld or something. Mhmm. And then he'd get out of it. And that's the kind of thing that I think makes TV shows so much better. Now of course, they did not let him do this, John. And it's because it was just too early.

Of course, it is the very end of the movie, and it does kind of reveal that Santa Man wins, but you can get a little sense of what it's like to deceive any Jones playing Santa Man. I think it works great. And this wanna do the Harry's out well. Harry's founders know that a great shave comes down to great blades made with sharp durable steel that last. That's why they make some of the highest quality blades in the world priced much lower than the leading brand and they will even give you a full refund if you don't love your shade as long as you let them know within thirty days. Harry stands behind the quality of their blade so they created a thirteen dollar you trial set that comes with everything you need for a closed comfortable shave. Weighted ergonomic handle, five blade razor with a lubricating strip and trimmer blade. Rich Lathering shave gel, Travel Blake cover you can claim yours by going to harry's dot com slash handbook and a a handbook And I believe there's also a field on the website where you can give your reactions to the Santa Man movie we are in the testing stage now, which is pretty important for the final cut. I I'll just say, I love I use Harry's razor. I love shading with it. I like that the the the handle is heavier than you would expect, and it gives me a a a nice shave close shave. And now our listeners can redeem their trial set at harry's dot com slash handbook and do testing on the Vinnie Jones Santa Man movie. So make sure you go to harrys dot com slash handbook to redeem your offer and let them know that I set you to help support the show and to do testing on the Santa Man movie. Hollywood Handbook.
