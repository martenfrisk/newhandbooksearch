Well, good news, listeners on my show can get five dollars off any Harry shave set by heading to harry's dot com slash the boys. So, you know, I'll just talk about it. Obviously, most of the time, we When we do Harry's, it's like a movie. We do, like, interior, whatever, and, like, there's a character named Santa Man. Who is a mascot of Harry's razors. We were actually told that we are not supposed to do that anymore. My understanding is that as we head into the Christmas season, you are not allowed to use Santa. We were contacted by a lawyer who said that DeSanta and Santa Man is copyrighted by I thought it would be about, like, by Coke or something. It's actually by the movie Fred Claus when that came out in, I think, two thousand seven, they realized that Santa and Santa Man copyrights were sitting there and available and they bought them. Movie was written by Dan Fogleman who created this as us, and he has actually been sitting on the Santa and Santa Man copyright. I believe Santa Man is in this is us this season because he can use it for free. So we were told by the lawyer's office that we are allowed to use, basically, a surrogate name, like a like, a fill in name for Santa or Santa Man. Let me find he he sent me a list of, like, possible names we could use. Okay. So he said instead of Santa Man, we can use the gift thrower reindeer race man, race man, loving good person, the childless sledster child I mean, I I guess he doesn't have any kids, and it just it's so weird. Red mister Howard bag, I guess because of the bag he carries, whisker supernatural Santor, I mean, not helpful. And then that is is close but not super helpful. The huge friend, Crimson bridges himself, Rudolph's stepfather, I don't think that is is correct in the in the lore. And the generous gentleman So none of those really struck me as, like, like, great replacements for the name Santaman. And so I, you know, I think it's good to just kinda proceed with the ad as is free shipping you go to harrys dot com slash the boys. You get five dollars off in a Harry shave set. Free shipping ends on December sixteenth, so act now. This is a practical gift that the guy will actually use with German engineered award winning blades that last all backed by a hundred percent quality guarantee. I like the Sherry Harry's shave set. I actually have very sensitive skin, and the lotion has been very easy on my skin. This is me Hayes talking. Holiday sets started just twenty dollars. That's within secret santa limits, I point out. As a special offer for fans of the show, we partner with Harry to give you five dollars any shave set, including their limited edition holiday sets when you go to harrys dot com slash the boys, plus you get free shipping. Each Harry's shaving set comes with a weighted handle with the option doing grave, by blade razor cartridges, filming shaved over a rich lather, travel cover to protect your blades, and this package in a handsome holiday gift box. Free shipping ends on December sixteenth. So act now, Just go to harrys dot com slash the boys. That's harrys dot com slash the boys.",
