I'm not supposed to say poster. But anyway, Anyway, common dot sean's a poster clothing is no longer and hey's was serving as my parole officer. You may remember from the last ad we did for five four clothing. Unfortunately, he was a bad boy. He did not do good job as prolog officer and he is back in poster jail and he is not holding up well. He had to join a gang in there and they don't like him. But now he can't join another gang because he kinda snubbed the one gang thinking he could join the cool one and is a tough situation. Anyway, we wanna say thanks again to five four clothing for sponsoring today's episode. Five four clothing is a sixty dollar a month high end clothing membership that will provide you with stylish clothes that are bound to you stand out in the crowd. Hey, and I love wearing these clothes. We got a couple. We're always wearing them. Hey, wore them into poster jail and he did get beat up and had the close taken away from him because that's how nice they are. He says that he traded them as part of the gang initiation, but he did not willfully give them up. So go to five four club dot com and use promo code handbook at sign up to get fifty percent off your first package which is huge percentage to get off and you're gonna love having these clothes and and you can trade them for friends the way hey's try to do in in poster jail hopefully with more success and hey, this is you're back.
