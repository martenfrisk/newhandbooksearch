    "line": "hey, everybody. It's me engineer Cody with the pre roll ad for Hollywood Handbook. You love and you love Amazon. And so here's a great way to shop at Amazon while supporting earwolf from Wolfpop to Oh, Amazon's so good. I'm always on their shopping for swing sets to put in my backyard so that more children will wanna complain in my yard because I'm still a big kid at heart and I still tend to eat dessert first, you know. And I can buy that on Amazon too. I go there to get this s'more flavored mochi ice cream. It's like a Japanese delicacy or something and it's so good. Anyway, if you go to earwool for wolf hop dot com slash Amazon, it'll take you to the same Amazon you know and love, but hold up. Wait a minute. Something's different, and it's that It's not that the prices are different. They're the same, but it's that you're gonna give a sweet kickback to earwolf for Wolfpop And that's who pays my bills, and and that's where you listen to Hollywood Handbook. Although Amazon did not buy an ad directly on their show, just sort of a general deal with your wolf that they're reading in place of an ad. Anyway, engineer Cody, out y'all",
