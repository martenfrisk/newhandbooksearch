    "line": "guys. I wanna talk about Squarespace. Turn your great idea into a reality with Squarespace. They make it easier than ever to launch your passion project whether you're showcasing your work or selling products of any kind. Obviously, over the last few weeks, I've talked about some not issues, but just, like, experiences that Sean has been having with Squarespace just to quickly recap he created a site called the peaceful Post, which was a blank sort of canvas where people could draw and post ideas about, like, how we could be peaceful with each other, and it would just be a a place for everyone on the Internet to share their ideas in drawings. And somebody wrote the doo doo man on the page, so it it's really just like a white space with someone writing the doo doo man on it. And Sean freaked out and when to find out who it was, he did discover it was the backpack kit. He tried to arrest the backpack kit, but he was doing the floss dance too quickly So Sean decided he had to become the backpack kid. He did I posted a YouTube video of him doing the floss dance, but He was doing it really, really fast and kind of, like, hitting himself in the butt a lot of the time as his hands were, like, passing by in the back. And looked like hurting himself a lot and, like, causing himself bad, like, medical injury. And so YouTube did take it down as part of their policy against violence and murder. And so Sean so so that actually takes us to the present day, which is that Sean is working on starting his own video site. Obviously, who better to partner for this than Squarespace. There have been a couple false starts on the domain front for him. He tried to buy squarespace dot com slash youtube, but that is apparently not how it works. Not allowed. That's their site still, basically. Then he tried to do a thing where he would get YouTube, not even u tub dot com, I think, just u tub, but he would write a a program where when you typed that in, like, possibly on your way to type YouTube, it would the program would automatically go to his different site. So it would basically create a trap door in the URL field on the way to YouTube and effectively disable all of YouTube's power and one would really even be able to reach it anymore because of this trapdoor. The browser software companies have not been flexible on that, they won't let him write this program for the browser software. And he did go around to each of them personally and brought food, what he described as fresh food, to have meetings with them, but they still were not interested in this concept or or the meeting. So now the work begins. I'm told on building a browser that will allow him to do trapdoor, or possibly even have a very small URL bar that has a six character limit. So YouTube would not even actually be allowed in the URL bar. Also, he has not yet been able to erase where it says the doo doo man the peaceful post. So do not go to the peaceful post right now. Wait until, like, under like, in the new browser, he feels like he'll be able to have that flexibility. So just wait until the new browser is finished, and then you will be able to go to YouTube, and you will be able to see the peaceful post. It'll all be on this new browser. With beautiful templates and the ability to customize just about anything, you can easily make a beautiful website yourself, And if you do get stuck, Squarespace's twenty four seven award winning customer support is there to help.

Whether you're looking to start a new business, showcase your work, publish content, sell products, and more, Squarespace is the tool for you, wanna give a quick update on what is going on with Sean and his, like, current Internet project just to quickly catch up. Sean is building a browser to allow him to do basically a trapdoor in the URL bar that will stop people from being able to go to YouTube because YouTube stopped him from posting a video of him doing the floss dance to replace the backpack kid who wrote the doo doo man on the peaceful post, which is his website that he built on Squarespace. The update is not great. He so I just wanna say this has nothing to do with Squarespace because Sean is building a browser, and he Squarespace does not a Squarespace lets lets you build websites and not browsers even though he made a a very convincing argument that should let him do a browser, they didn't really feel like they had the capacity to do that. So Sean, the browser is All the pieces are there, but they're kind of like a lot of them are moving around. The URL bar keeps sliding off. So it's, like, up there for a minute when he's, like whenever he shows it to me, it feels like when when he says when he's doing it, it works fine. But whenever he tries to show it to somebody, the URL bar kind of slides down. Like, first really slowly and then, like, kinda fast. So it is hard to actually, like, catch to click on it to type in the website that you wanna go to. And the there's, like, no button to make it larger And right now, it's kinda like, the screen like, the window is kinda small, and a little corner of it looks like it's broken somehow. So and this is all browser stuff. It's not Squarespace. Squarespace is great.

It's the carry on suitcase that comes in two sizes and even more colors in two and two materials. The strong aluminum and the brave polycarbonate. If it breaks, it will fix it as soon as they read your message, and you send it to them and they give it back. Fix her, it's a new one. And you can even try it for one hundred days, enough time to make one hundred vacations that are close together. And you can give it back then after that, unless you put your name or other letters on which you can do, even the letters, n o t from Wayworld. You can look at the suitcase in real life at the away store in New York, San Francisco, Boston LA or Chicago, London, Austin. I got the away suitcase and took it on a trip to a country, Japan. And I put my phone in the plug, and the battery had more energy for my trip. On the trip I saw some animals I'd never seen before and everything looked different, I tried sushi even though I was only there for one morning and then had to go home. For twenty dollars off a suitcase, visit away travel dot com slash handbook and use promo code handbook during checkout.
