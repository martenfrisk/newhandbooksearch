Video blocks is an affordable subscription based stock media site that gives you unlimited access to premium stock footage. Whether you're making a montage of cartoon characters getting decapitated set to that one vertical horizon song you like or just indulging your foot fetish, the benefits are numerous. There's great value with the unlimited download model, unlimited downloads to the library of a hundred thousand plus HD video clips after effects, templates, and motion backgrounds. Two hundred and fifty thousand graphics. On average subscribers pay less than a dollar per download over the course of a year. That's almost nothing. And in terms of whether you feel like I'm judging you with those examples, I like that vertical horizon song too. So I would never judge someone for that. There's premium content, the same content you would find on more expensive stock sites but we have it here for less. Great variety of time lapse aerials, US international locations, slow motion, nature shots, if you know what I mean, and more. Continuingously adding new content to the library so it stays fresh is a real priority for video blocks, and don't forget their simple unrestricted licensing. Everything's a hundred percent royalty free. Now I told them they should make it ninety percent royalty free. I said at least take a ten percent royalty and video bucks punched me in the face. Unrestricted usage rights or for personal or commercial projects and you get to keep what you download and maintain usage rights forever. Or until you die. Wanna know more, go to video blocks dot com slash promo slash hollywood handbook and sign up for your own subscription today. And if you don't do that then I'll know there's something wrong with you and you wouldn't want that to get out there. Would you?",

Cash tags are like hashtags but with dollar sign instead of the pound sign. And even better because you can use to pay money. Now here at Hollywood Handbook, we have our very own cash tag and in order to use it, you can go to cash dot me slash dollar sign hollywood handbag handbook. Not handbag. That's for ladies. I don't have a handbag. Anyway, You can use it at cash dot me slash dollar sign Hollywood Handbook and you can donate that way or just click the donate button on our site. You can form your own cash tag and personalize it. For instance, maybe one of my friends could have a cash tag that went cash tag betrayer liar or cash tag stupid dumb guy or maybe cash tag all I had to do was rent a dog costume. I didn't have to make one out of dog so that it would be quote more realistic. Any of those hashtags would apply to this one friend or maybe if you're my other friend's boss, you would be hashtag mean guy and hashtag said some things that maybe I should be taking back to Sean. Anyway, have fun with it, make it your own use cash tags, use square cash, and be safe out there this Halloween weekend.",
