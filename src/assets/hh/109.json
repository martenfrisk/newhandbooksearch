And now you can get fifty dollars toward any mattress purchase by going to casper dot com slash handbook and using the code handbook. I of course am Sean Clemens, one of the hosts of Hollywood Handbook, a podcast on which we advertise Casper mattresses a very comfy mattress according to the hosts of many other podcasts. Jason Manzuka says that the combination of latex foam and memory foam is just so good. It's got just the right sink. Lauren Lapkis said that the bounce is perfect no matter how you sleep, Andrew Tee celebrates their risk free trial and return policy. Now you're probably wondering why am I talking about these other hosts who love the mattress. They Susan Orleen says it's five hundred dollars for a twin size mattress at nine fifty for a king sized mattress. Well, I'll tell you why I am talking about them because I kinda have to take their word for it because Casper mattresses has been sending free mattresses to the hosts of the other podcasts that advertise them, but not to us. And so I just want you to know that when you use the code handbook, you are sending money to a very Civic podcast which is at this perfect range where we are good enough that we should be used as an advertiser for a product but we are not quite great enough that we would get a free mattress in the way that Paul Sheer, or a Scott Ocerman naturally, or let me think who else Oh, I bet fucking Tyler Labine got one. So get fifty dollars towards any mattress purchase by going to cash dot com slash handbook and using code handbook to support the show. That's good but not great.

Smell is the sense most closely related to memories. Sense, s e n s e, not s c e n t s, which is what he was saying before when he said the sense of his childhood. He remembers curling up close to the vent the drier steam would leak out when his mom was doing a load of laundry and the smell he would inhale so deeply it. And how he desired to be closer to it somehow. It was a smell that was at the same time thrilling and from strating. How could he have more of it?
