    "line": "hey, guys. It's Hayes. Got great news for you. You can now hear all eight seasons of Doug Love's movies on Stitcher Premium. Comedian Doug Benson loves a movie so much. He made a podcast about it. Well, that is not how that happened. I remember how that show got started. This is what that is not that he loved movies so much he made a podcast about it. So Doug Benson, when he was first developing the show, it was a lot it was like a live Largo thing. He did a series of Largo shows. Of this show, but at the time it was called Doug Love's peach pie and he he had a peach pie on stage and he would have guests on and they would talk about that peach pie. And they they there was a version of the Leonard Walton game but I it didn't have anything to do with movie. It was like I forget how that game works, but it it was all peach pie stuff. There was no movies involved. And then after that he did a bunch of them. I think he did ten of the same peach pie and it never so I think the peach pie was also like a fake pie, like somebody he had built. And based on the show, like honestly, you know, it's years and a half later I can say this. I don't think he really like he knew what he was talking about. I think this is what he sort of thought people would like. And so we Sean and I were trying to figure out what to say to it. I forget which of us it was that finally brought this. Oh, no. It was Wayne Rooney. It was Wayne Rooney. Wayne Wayne Rudy said, oh, like, oh, dog. Won't you do a sport of movies in? And not not be doing the peach pie over and over, and you can do, you know, different movies. And Doug is, like, movies. Alright. I'll I'll try it. And, like and I think he meant, like, will try watching a movie and I'll see if I like that. And I think he did kinda like it. But I think he also responded to Wayne saying, like, if you you can do more about movies than you can about this one Peach pie that I think is fake. That's me saying it's fake, not not Wayne did not mention that. But so you can hear bonus the VAT and the Benson interruption completely ad free, and he also did he would interrupt the pie. That that actually did sort of work. That's over a thousand hours of Doug Benson podcast for just four ninety nine a month or thirty four ninety nine a year.

We have done a few ads for these guys, and I I will be the first to say that we didn't hit the mark on those ads, we love Chapman University. They unlike some other companies, have been very good about playing along with the kind of stuff that we do in ads where sometimes we like we just like to have a little fun with them, and they have really encouraged that. But we haven't held up our end of the bargain and we have overstepped our bounds a lot times with with our ads for Chapman. So we decided to sort of meet in the middle and they are actually writing their own copy Now the sort of fun copy that we had attempted to do and failed so badly at, it has now been written by Chapman for these ads. So I am I haven't seen it. Let me open it up now. And I'll get into this. Okay. Chapman University Midrule. Here we go. Hey, you piece of chap. Did you know that those who hold master degrees earn on average twenty thousand dollars more a year, a piece of crap. That's much worse than anything we that's like piece of crap. Why would why would they say that? Is this the yeah. Okay. This is it. Alright. I'll just keep going. Located in Sunny Southern California, a Chapman offers more than seventy graduate degrees across ten schools and colleges with programs in business, law, science, education, the arts and more. Good one of these or we'll give you a bitch chap. Oh my god. This I mean, the stuff we did was so tame. A bitch like a bitch slap? In the I would never say that in an ad. Programs range from the unique to the innovative, like their masters in economic systems design and PhD in computational and data sciences. Does that chap your butt cheeks? And that's something I thought of, but decided not to say. Plus, with the goal of meeting the ever growing need for healthcare professionals, Chapman now offers masters in doctoral degrees in pharmacy, physical therapy, PA, and speech therapy at the new Rinker Health Science campus in Irvine, come into one of our schools and get a chapsmere Oh my God. And of course Chapman's Dodge College of film and media arts offers MA and MFA degrees and producing screenwriting and production design plus dual MFA NBA and MFA JD degrees. It's one of the top ten film schools in the country and Justin Simien from Dear White people who created it went there. It's a weird way to phrase that. And the Duffer Brothers who created stranger things went there too. And if you don't go there, we'll kid trap you and throw you into a bear trap Go to chatman dot edu grad if you're thinking of advancing your career or starting a new one, Chatman University, I'd chap that. I just their notes were always to do less And this is so much worse than I would have ever Well, alright.",
