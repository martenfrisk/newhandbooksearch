There's a weighted ergonomic handle five blade razor with a lubricating strip and trimmer blade. Rich lathering shave gel, travel blade cover. And people can claim there by going to harrys dot com slash handbook. Hey, it's Aquaman. What's up? Get out of here aquaman. Okay. I love shaving with Harry's because the friggin gel feels so good on my skin that basically it feels even better than when I used to put this coconut cream that I used to have when I was a little boy. So that's what feels so good to me. Is Moriardi still out there? Well I'm still here. He's right a dolphin. He's on our tail again. Oh, no. Oh, well, I guess the thing that you really need to know is that listeners to Hollywood Handbook can redeem their trial set at harry's dot com slash handbook. Dolphin. Don't do a barrel roll.

We love talking to you about Casper and, of course, you know, that nothing is more important to Hayes and I than you starting your summer off right by choosing the internet's favorite mattress this memorial day. A lot of people have been saying they think there's only one line to choose from. I beat those people up. I throw them in the dumpster. That's not okay to say anymore. There's three lines to choose from. There's the original Casper. There's the innovative wave. That one's really wavy. And then there's the streamlined essential. That one's streamlined and it's actually essential. Every Casper mattress is designed to help you sleep cool and regulate your body temperature throughout the night and you can be sure of your purchase with their hundred night free sleep on a trial. Now they have their own offers. This company does their own offers. They're doing just fine on their own. Returns will have free if you're not satisfied. But I am actually gonna sweeten the deal because Hayes and I have been offering specific dreams that we can guarantee you will have if you buy a Casper mattress through this podcast. And this month's dream, the Memorial Day Dream is super cool and really special. I can't believe we were able to lock this up. But chef Kevin will come into your dreams and he will cook you an advanced four course meal. Obviously, because it's a memorial day offer, some of it's gonna be him you know, firing up the grill, isn't that right, chef Kevin?",

And then the other four guys have kind of, as they're having this argument, cornered off and they close in from all sides and just start kicking the fucking shit out of this guy. And then it happens for twenty seconds and then they all back off and he gets up and he could just see he has no idea where he is. He's kinda trying to walk away. And they like let him get like two steps and then they just fucking close in and do it again and his girlfriend is just screaming. I'm sitting on the car I've left the concert a little early because I am so sick from all the drugs and alcohol in my system. And so I'm just, like, on my buddy's car waiting for them to come out of the concert. The concert's not over. And I'm, like, alone there. And I'm being like, well, I mean, I'm not I cannot be involved in this. Like, I should a hero would help. That's not what I am. So I watch and then what was amazing is that almost immediately an ambulance pulled up. And they put the guy in the back of it and the girlfriend like got in with him and drove away and the other guys had disappeared but I was like what was the system where they were informed I didn't do it.
