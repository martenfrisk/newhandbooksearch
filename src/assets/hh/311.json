Well, as you may remember, I was specter living in the mid eighteen hundreds until me and my friend Welden who was short of just an ambiguous wild west character realized that we were living in a western themed water park in what you would call modern times. The year twenty nineteen. And Mac upon discovering this passed out face down on the sidewalk out add to water park, and then when he was revived, retreated to the water park in fear and is pretending that none of this ever occurred, and I weldon decided to immerse myself in the present day and I did learn to code and I became a end developer and I ended up marrying a human rights attorney and for a while was acclimated to the present day quite well, but I have been having a number of episodes where I I it seems that I miss My old life, I find myself panning for things at inappropriate moments, I'll be washing the dishes and I'll just start shaking the dish back and forth as if silt is going to fall through with holes in the dish that aren't there revealing nuggets of gold. This became such an issue that my wife did leave So, I am speaking to you from an empty residence. I did go back and visit my friend Mac recently at the water park called Gizzard Gulture something like that. I don't exactly remember. And he's just having the time of his life, he will not acknowledge that he lives in the present day, but he just seems so happy and dad gummed if I'm not sure exactly what my next move is gonna be. Hey, a good outfit starts with the basics. And Mac Weldon is the premium Men's essentials brand you should be shopping. Not only does Mac Weldon's underwear socks shirts look good, they perform well too. And if you don't like your first pair of underwear, you can keep it, and they will still refund you. No questions asked. I love wearing these clothes. Now that I don't wear old dungarees anymore, although part of me does mister feel them quite a bit. I like wearing my fresh modern, good looking men's underwear and socks and shirts. I have a hoodless sweatshirt. That I think is particularly comfortable, especially as the weather starts to cool down. For twenty percent off your first order visit, mackweldon dot com and enter promo code The Boys.",

It's because they were not meant to be worn that way. Untuck it is the brand you've been looking for because they're specifically designed to be worn untucked. Now, I This is not an approved part of the ad. I'm going off script a little bit here, which we don't usually do. But I wanna be honest with you guys because you are my best friends. I was just in Washington, DC meeting with some very high ranking members of the government. I was pitching some parody songs that I thought they could have fun with. There's like this big DC kind of comedy festival every year inside the government and I've been known to do punch up, you know, sorta like how different comics will have someone write roast jokes for them for those comedy central roast. I'm kinda like that, but I work for like different senators and secretaries, vice presidents, and all of that. So anyway, I was in there and I was pitching Here I am, late Senate or John McCain. I was like somebody could play that I was doing the Lizzo song, but it was I just took a DNA test turns out of one hundred percent that Mitch McConnell And there was crushing, but I happened over here that there is a bill being brought to the hill to make it illegal to where those traditional shirts untucked. And only untucked shirts will be allowed to be worn untucked. And I've actually even seen some people getting arrested already. As part of a trial run. So if you're like me and you are casual and cool and you don't wanna have your shirt tucked in all the time, but you also don't wanna go to freaking jail Then just get the original untucked shirt. It's a modern solution to an old problem with no tucking or tailing required. No matter your size or shape, these shirts are the perfect untucked length with more than fifty fit combinations, untucket shirts look great on tall, short, slim, and athletic guys, of all ages, and I could vouch for the last one. Now you can shop online or visit one of the untucked stores, you know, I got I went in there and I got these flannels, and they were soft, and they were nice. And I'm wearing them untucked with no fear of repercussions from our government. So You can try it on in person at one of the untuck it fifty stores or go to untuck it dot com to get started. They even offer free shipping and returns on all orders in the US you can save twenty percent on your first order by using my code, not Hazes, I'm giving you this one. It's the boys at checkout. That's u n t u c k I t dot com. Promo code, the boys. And I forgot what a c looked like for a second and that could happen to anyone.",

    "line": "they'll tell you it's less about the brush and more about how you use it. That's why you need Quip. As a world class professional comedienne, I always have equipment in my mouth, but now it's actually doing something positive for a change. So that's a that's a little joke that I wrote. Almost proving in a way that I am a world class community and I have used the word quip, which is spelled the same when they talk about the toothbrush, but I have done it to mean a witticism. And that in itself is very witty. It's sort of like the built in comedy you get when you're dealing with an for me is kinda like the built in timer that Quip uses. So dentists are like, hey, you gotta brush your teeth for two minutes. Quip goes, we're just gonna time it for you. We don't want you thinking about all that other stuff. Let us take some of the work off your plate. This is like what I'm always asking Shrek having to do is like, why don't you take some of this stuff off so that I don't have to focus on a million things at once. And he's like, come in. Anyway, the thirty second pulse is ensure and even clean. I've talked about this in the past. Some people wanna pretend that their mouth is existing in four separate compartments and do each one for thirty seconds. I go crazy. I go everywhere. I try to race myself to see how much I can get done of my mouth within the thirty seconds before I have to start over or continue on to another area. But it's fun to think of your mouth as a crazy map that you are are a maze, I guess, that you're going through. So Quip automatically delivers brush heads to you every three months for clean new bristles right on schedule. The sleek intuitive design is simple to use and comes with a travel cap that doubles as a mirror amount too. That's only if you have space on your mirror. My mirror is covered in stickers from all the punk shows that I've been to this month. But some people have room to mount their toothbrush. Simply put Quip makes brushing something US actually want to do twice a day and good habits matter to live a healthier life. And this would be a great place for me to have come up with a second Quip. Anyway, for me, it's gentle, it's nice, I love that I don't have to time things for two minutes or think about whether it's been three months. They take all the time stuff off my schedule so I can just have fun the way that I would want the podcast to work. So did the timer help me yet? Did. Did I love that my gums don't hurt afterwards as much as with the other kind of electric toothbrush I tried a long time ago? Yeah. I like that. They start at just twenty five dollars and you'll get your first refill at get quip dot com for free if you go to get quip dot com slash the boys. It's a simple way to support our show and start brushing better. You have to go to get q u I p dot com slash the boys to get your first refill. Free, and that's on us.",

That can confuse anyone and derail your fitness journey. So I do want to be very transparent about this ad. Jeff Kevin seemingly in an effort to get me to record it, decided to offer me an idea for what to do for the ad, the idea is as follows. You can say that I start chef Kevin's dumbbell dining hall where people pay me to work out in a space I've rented out that I call a dining hall. We're we're we're talking about kettlebell kitchen. So I assume that's what led to the suggestion of chef Kevin's dumbbell dining hall. And this leads me to something I'm forced to say which I do not say lightly, and it pains me to have to say it. But the only dumbbell here is chef Kevin himself. And I also need to share that I actually have gone on a diet. From this joke because it is very thin soup. To continue talking about kettlebell kitchen, kettlebell offers a nutrition you need without any of the hassle Their goal is to help you achieve yours with meal plans that are tailored to your needs. Sign up for a plan or order a la carte, no long term contracts required. Then meals get delivered to your door twice a week for optimal freshness. You don't need to worry about sourcing ingredients or fretting over macro macros. Just heat serve and get the food you need for real sustainable change, and there are vegetarian keto whole thirty and paleo options available. I enjoyed the food. I got some vegetarian options that were very tasty, very easy to make and healthy. And you guys know me, I love a balanced diet. A beer in each hand. And that is why I do not need suggestions from chef Kevin, who, as I stated previously, is the only dumbbell here. Feed the champion in you with kettlebell kitchen Go to kettlebell kitchen dot com and enter code the boys for twenty five dollars off each of your first two orders for new customers. That's twenty five dollars off of your first two orders at kettlebellkitchen dot com, code the Boys.",
