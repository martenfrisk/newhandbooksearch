It, you know, doesn't matter. But this week, in one of the pallets, there was a note from a guy named Waddeus Law. I don't know how to pronounce the first and last letter is a w. Who I guess works on the manufacturing line somewhere for our show. And the note just said, Hello. I am wadis Law. Very sad today because I cannot do ad.
