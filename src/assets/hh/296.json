It's time for spring cleaning, and Quip's got a easy way to start with your brushing habits. As one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the and dental association. Quip can help pave the way to a healthier mouth and mind in just two minutes twice a day. Not to mention with brush heads delivered on a dentist recommended schedule of every three months for just five dollars. Quip provides the friendly reminder to stay committed to your oral health. Now the whole family can get refreshed with Quip, thanks to the new kids' Quip, which has the same two minute timer in guiding pulse as their original version. No childish gimmicks, just kid friendly features like a small brush head. Watermelon, anti cavity toothpaste, and rubber grip handles in colors little ones will love. So now the whole family can have their teeth cleaned, mom, dad, the baby, and even Austin Powers. So this is, like, Colin, our boss is from like, England or like Britain, and he has a tie in that he wants to do. He keeps saying that he's friends with Austin Powers. I think he, like, no honestly, I think he, like, know someone who knows Austin powers. I don't think Bay are really friends. And he's not, like, in his phone. He's, like, shown me all his, like, phone contacts and Austin powers is not really in there. And all his phone numbers start with o one one, like, plus o one one, But he says if we can get Austin powers to, like, brush his teeth with Quip and, like, fix even his famously rotting teeth, he says, r I don't like r o t t y. Then that would be, like, huge for us. And for the podcast, we we could do, like, an episode with Austin Powers. I don't really think this is gonna happen. But he wants me to set it up in this app. So even Austin Powers will have nice teeth and fresh breath. I like Quip. I use I love it. I use it at home, using it today while I'm doing my chores, I use it this morning when I do it again tonight. I like the toothpaste, and Sean likes it for his sensitive teeth. And that's why over one million happy healthy mouths love Quip two. Quip starts at just twenty five dollars and if you go to get quip dot com slash the boys right now, you can get your first refill pack for free.

And I wanna tell you guys about Audible. Audible. Listening makes a smarter more connected people and there's no better place to start listening than Audible. Audible is where inspiring voices and compelling stories open listeners up to new ways of thinking. And members, now get more than ever before. You can choose three titles every month, one audiobook, plus two Audible originals, that you can't hear anyone anywhere else. And they deliver bestsellers, business, self improvement, memoirs, and more, all professionally created by actors, authors, and motivational superstars like Rachel Hollis, David Goggins, and Mel Robbins. Wow. There is something that they want to make very clear, which is that chef Kevin, our producer on the show, actually did submit them an audiobook, and it's they want us to make clear in the ad that they did not accept this book. So some people, I guess, have been worried that this book is gonna be available to them in any form on Audible. And they just wanna say they did not accept it. It's not something you can find on Audible. It's called Kevin's Tripp. I have a little bit actually of the it's like, I guess, kind of a paperback thriller. I don't know. Oh, sorry. It's called mister Kevin's trip. Mister Kevin. So I I have a clip from it that I I'll play just to say, like, this is not available on Audible. This is not a book that you can buy on Audible and it's very important that you know that. Mister Kevin walked into the gangster's lair with a nasty grin. All of the guys in there backed off when they saw his tie. So I guess earlier in the book, he finds a tie with Thor on it that makes him, like, feel brave, I guess, or like, I don't I don't know if it, like, actually gives him abilities. It's, like, kind of unclear. Mister Kevin went up to the boss of the entire room. He saw the guy looking at him, seeing anything you like, he said? It's all for sale. What? Oh, so I'll just keep playing it. Not much said the boss. Well, see how you like this, mister Kevin. Hand over all the mayor's documents or I'll start getting naked in here. So I guess the idea, like, this sequence as it plays out is mister Kevin slowly gets naked. Like, piece by piece, article of clothing one at a time until, like, he like, to get the club shut down, and the boss is, like, scared that his club is gonna be shut down because it's not allowed to be naked in there. And so he hands over the mayor's documents. I don't really know what the word that I didn't finish the thing. Audible members can also get free access to the New York Times Wall Street Journal, and and post delivered daily to the Audible App. Access Audible anytime on any device, it will always pick up right where you left off. I listen to a lot of books on there. Let me see what I listened to recently. I have to make sure that mister Kevin's trip can't just, like, make it into my audible app on my my phone. Or I'm listening to the sympathizer by viet tann mian. I think it's how you pronounce His name, it's a very smart book. It's much smarter than mister Kevin's trip. Start listening with a thirty day audible trial in your first audiobook plus two audible originals are free.

And I bought some gaming clothes to go over to Sean's and to play PlayStation some gloves, some dockers, some, like, a a birkin bag for, like, snacks and stuff. I Sean then got in touch with me and said that his PlayStation was breaking. And he said that he, like, tried to get help figuring I guess, like so he bought a Blu ray, which I had also heard, like, you can do PlayStation on. And we've had a lot of conversations about it, but it's not, like, doing the right at least not the right games. Is what he's telling me. And so if anyone is listening and does know how to do PlayStation on the Blu Ray and how to control the guy with the, like, the remote that comes with it and how to do online. Like, go online and play your friends online because we want to play the how did this get? Play people online and, like, sort of, get some attention from that. That would be great.
