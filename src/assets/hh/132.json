    "line": "Wow. That's really wrong of you. Boy, that's aunt wrong, some son of a mama. Let me think. There's really only one thing that's aren't right, which is I love h h. Although you're even aren't wrong about that because if you love h h, you do really care about Sean's take on film because the whole fucking show is just my fucking take and Hayes's take on fucking media and television and film and Hollywood and actors and people in the entertainment industry and the way they behave and that is what HH is. So basically, you either do love HH or you don't really care about Sean's take on film and maybe you don't care about my take on film because you just wanted to put out your take on film and have your low moment where you get to feel like Sean on Hollywood Handbook who gets to tell everybody what he thinks about the different things he sees. And you're gonna now be the smart guy and actually know what's really going on in midnight special. And that you actually have to admit in your review that everyone agrees the film loses your words a little when it gives away some of the early mysticism. Well, the whole fucking first half of the movie is just hinged on you being curious about the early ism and the cult and all that. And it essentially is just the audience sort of putting together the puzzle pieces of trying to figure out exactly what's going on. And my experience was as soon as I'd gotten the edges of the puzzle in place, I found out that the entire center of the puzzle was just one big piece that got dropped in in a moment but I still had to sit there and look at the finished puzzle for another hour and twenty minutes. So my experience at the film was not that enjoyable, but you liked it. So I guess you the person who does have a take on film we all need to hear. And is it true? I guess that comedians don't make good critics? Is that a good characterization to make that entire profession would make good critics? A profession who basically only thinks about media and people and structuring stories and jokes and trying to come up with ways to surprise, comedy is just surprise. We've gone over that. Which is something that maybe a lot of films wanna try to do too give you information in an entertaining and surprising way. And isn't that what comedians wanna do? And I also wonder since you know so much what jobs are good critics What exactly is your job that makes you such a good critic? I mean, I know that you're on Reddit writing a comment, so you must be what? The fucking a o Scott from the fucking New York times? Or are you just some fucking schmuck who didn't like what I said about a movie because you liked it and maybe you feel dumb that you didn't get it that they screwed up the movie. And by the way, if I don't like the fucking parts of imitation game where it's a bunch of little kids acting and I did like the other parts of it and I wanna to stop going back to that. That doesn't mean that I don't understand the concept of characterization. It means I didn't enjoy watching that part of the film and I'm allowed to say that without someone taking the entire profession, which by the way, I'm not really comedian. I'm actually fucking screenwriter and that's what I get paid to do more than I don't do fucking stand up jokes. Okay? So, yeah, I think I thought a lot about stories and fucking putting them on the screen for people to enjoy. So let's just that's just a side, no. But what is it that you do again? I can't remember. So anyway, it's a nitpick to you They're from forty minutes into the film. I don't like the movie anymore. I don't know. That doesn't feel that nitpicky to me. There were plenty of plot twists for you. Let me ask you something, son of a mama. Was there any point where you didn't think the kid was going to get to the fucking drop zone at the moment that he needed to be there?",
