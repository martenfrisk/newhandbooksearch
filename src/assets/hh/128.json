    "line": "hey, guys. Today's show is sponsored by How often it's like Netflix or Podcasts with how premium you get exclusive access to dozens of Hall original miniseries, like the mysterious secrets of Uncle Bird's Bidenarium, originally sound designed adventure comedy starring Germaine Clement from fight of the Concord sounds like no podcast you've ever heard. Yeah. Access sorry. I'm I'm a little scared. We I we set up a separate record to to do these ads and Sean, I think, is lost. I left open the door of the studio and he there's like a sort of a muffin guy nearby, he, like, works outside and he makes these muffins in a little cart. And he cooks them out there and the smell is something that's always been very attractive to Sean while we're trying to record, and I left the door open, and I smell the muffins now. And so I what I realized happened is I think Sean went to sort of pursue the muffin guy. When that happens, the the the muffin guy tends to sort of run away. And so what it I'm sure is happening as Sean is chasing the muffin guy down the street and I worry about because like when he is really hungry for savory muffin really is what he likes is the kind of a gruyere and kale sorts of muffins because that's a that's breakfast for him that he likes to say. He he will not be paying a lot of attention to cars or traffic lights or anything and I'd worried that once they start honking at him, he'll get very disoriented and maybe sort of you know, do something crazy or I don't know. But the just podcast is the podcast is great. Or uncle Berdy's binerium is so good. You access it on your iPhone, your Android phone, and on on the web, four ninety nine a month.

Don't let them eat wintergreen lifesavers and crunch them in the dark. Don't let them do anything that would really even don't let them be in like a hot car because sometimes the sun coming through the glass can react badly with the material and I think just because there was so much writing on the posters people weren't able to read that. So I wanna say it here as sort of a disclaimer. Get five four. If you're grown up, you want good clothes, great. You'll look great. If you want your kid to really be set apart and have people be like holy shit. It's fucking poster clothes. Do that, you know, come to me.
