But internet dot b s is not basketball. It's a low fuss, low cost website to buy your domain names. What's great about Internet dot b s is that they don't try to sell you a whole heap of products you don't need. They leave out the b s. They just sell domain names. They are consistently the best price for a destroyer in the market today. Internet dot b s also gives you free who is privacy, free email web forwarding, and they'll let you use their DNS for free. All this just for buying a domain name. I bought rebekah lobo dot biz for only six dollars. That's how much they're selling biznam domains for I can't believe that. I'm putting up a great website for basketball. And for my charity. So there's never been a time to take your business to the next level with a web address that means business on a dot biz domain. I'm Rebecca Lobo. Forget about all those other registrar's and web providers. Go to internet dot b s backslash hollywood handbook right now and show the world the union business. With a slam dunk dot biz domain name for just six dollars.",

Earlier in this episode, we had an advertisement for internet dot b s where it was ostensibly Rebecca Lobo, the former basketball player for the W NBA, endorsing internet dot b s on behalf of Hollywood Handbook. That was not Rebecca Lobo. That was me. She was alerted to the this discrepancy, I guess, between when the pre roll aired and and now, She visited me in my home, and she kind of stuffed me into a back basketball shape, and she dunked me into a trash can and I have to stay a basketball for the rest of my life. And she she is still here. What what she wants me to communicate is that internet dot b s is not this was all me, internet internet dot b s should not be responsible for this mistake mistake. I thought it would be good if we could get like a real celebrity doing spokesman stuff on our show. I made a mistake. I was wrong. Internet dot b s you know, all the stuff about them is true, free private who is, free web forwarding, free email forwarding, free DNS management. Six dollars for a dot biz domain name. Consistently, the best price registered in the market, large range of choices, dot biz, is the perfect choice for your business website or idea. I'm sorry. I just my my bones aren't broken, they're like curve. She curves my bones. So to make me into a basketball, But it hurts more than if they're broken, I think. I've really just have time to do this ad, and then I think I'm gonna pass out for a a long time. Go to internet dot b s backslash hollywood handle right now.

So Casper brings together two comfy technologies, latex foam and memory foam. Now most people if you're like me, you hear the word latex and you go, I know what that does. That protects me from liquids. So then, I'm here and that's in a mattress. Is this mattress like made for people who pee their beds like like their little kid? Yes. It is. That's how that that is who can use this mattress. It doesn't say in the ad copy that that's exclusively who it's for and you probably could sleep on it too and should if you're a normal guy or like normal's the wrong word. But if you don't like piss your bed when you're asleep, but if you do you don't even have to tell me, but just you could buy this mattress and it says it's got latex in it. So that's got to be good. Right? Look, guys, You spend about a thirty year life sleeping and I believe my rough estimate is you spend about three quarters to almost yeah. Three quarters to eighty percent of your life going to the bathroom. It's obviously gonna have some overlap where part of the time that you spend going to the bathroom is also the time you spend sleep. There's nothing wrong with that. So like, if you're doing that, get the freaking mattress that says right in it. It's got latex. That's it's right there for you. They got a risk free trial and return policy. They'll deliver it straight to you. You could try it for a hundred days and, like, If you go to a normal store, right, you get to lay on the matches for a minute. And if you happen to have to go to the bathroom during that time, they get so mad. Like really it's kinda out of proportion with the problem, I think, that some of the employees at Sears or whatever if you're in one of their mattresses, they're just like wigging out. I'm like, dude, relax. Why don't you be more like cast spur. Let me have it for a hundred days, and then I can, like, switch it out for a fresh one or just return it, but why would I return it? It's got latex and that's what's great. It's five hundred dollars for a twin size mattress and nine fifty for a king size mattress, which if you compare that to industry averages at the places where they're really rude to you, it's like this is a better price and you get fifty dollars towards any mattress purchased by going to casper dot com slash handbook and using code handbook. Terms and conditions apply. So whether you're a normal guy or a guy who has to pee when you're asleep, it's The mattress for you is the one that c a s p e r.",
