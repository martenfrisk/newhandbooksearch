    "line": "Hey, guys. Some kind of exciting news in this ad. As you know in the past we've done ads for nudist colony t shirts and we changed the way we pronounced the name of nudist colony to nudy Street, Colonel of New York so nobody would get confused about the idea of a nudism and wearing t shirts. Confusing combination of ideas. And then the actual nudy Street colonel of New York got mad and he tried to send the army to beat us up. And then we found out that the News Street, Colonel, New York doesn't have that many friends in the army and the army was actually thinking that we were the cool ones and they don't like him. So we were talking to some of our new army friends the other day at the army. Me and Sean went there And they offered to go punch in Newey Street, Colonel, New York for us. And we were like, no. Like, that's all over with is just about like this is all over a t shirt company even though the t shirts are really good and you get one every month for only thirty bucks even though they normally cost a hundred bucks in the store and they have different kinds like Henleys and Vleenex and stuff. The teachers are good, but we don't want anyone to be punched over it. But the army members, the guys who participated in the army were sort of riled up at that point and one of them did go to the New Street colonel in New York and not punch him but kind of mush his face like put his whole hand on his face and mush it backwards. And the New Street code of New York fell back right in front of a tank that was exploding and the the tank blew a hole in his hair like right through his hair and it's very hard to explain but he had this still has this very kind of high hair. It's not like a beehive, but it like kind of piles up in this very unusual way. His hair sort of looks like a big pile. Of hair. And now it has a big hole in it. So anyway we we felt bad about this because he did start to cry and he cries in this very low voice. This this very low, long, long cry So we asked if he would like to do the ad at the end of the show. So that's that's gonna be at",

    "line": "Hollywood handbook. Hey everybody. It's me Hayes Davenport from Hollywood Handbook, and I'm here to tell you that a bird went to the bathroom on my head today and that I liked it. So let's deal with Harry's razors. They're a company, they're advertising here, and they've got razors for you. Stop that compromising you're doing on your shave and you go get started with Harry as you double. You're probably either paying too much for a comfortable shave or settling for low price, low quality, and just knock it off, and they've got something you never had before. Great shave at a fair price, heard of it, and now you did. They make their own high quality razors and they cut out the middle man and then ship them directly to you for half the price. They should be the razr, not the middle man. And so I should clarify too when I was talking about a bird went to the bathroom on my head earlier and how much I liked it. And he did a big number two, and that's what I mean. And it got all over me. So good shape, good price. It's simple. Get the best of both worlds with Harry's, and I know that when I was getting the bathroom gone to to on me. By bird today, I was thinking, oh, wow, this is gonna get all in my beard. And it did in my stubble, my in my haze face, and it when And it also got in my mouth because I was singing. I was under a tree and I was looking up and I was singing and having fun and I was just really belting out that song three AM, the matchbox twenty song, and I was like really going for it. And it was kind of a mash up that I do between that and that jewel song which talks about how small our hands are. And the bird let loose just a ferocious torrent, and it got all in my mouth, but also in my beard. And I thought, oh, wow. You know, when you shave, I already know what razor I'm gonna use, but Harry's actually mentions like you might wanna use their moisturizing shave cream, which smells great, or some people prefer a gel. And I actually prefer a third option, which is I take the movement of animal now and and I use that to lubricate my face so I don't get nicks and scrapes. Harry's is just one razor that has all you need for a close comfortable shave, five German crafted blades, flex hinge lubricating strip, quality guaranteed, full refund if you're not happy. You know, cut out the middleman, please. It's just fifteen dollars. It includes The starter kit is just fifteen dollars includes the razor, three blades, your choice of Harry, shave cream, foaming gel, or obviously, you know what I use that is free actually. Because it's from nature. And so vegans will, like, what I do, just I let a bird go to the bathroom on me. When I'm singing, And as an added bonus, you get five dollars off with your first purchase of my code, with my code handbook, h a n d b o o k after you use my code, Me Hayes Davenport, you'd get an entire month's worth of shaving for just ten dollars. It was started harry's dot com was started by two guys who were passionate about creating a better shaving experience. For all men as passionate as I am, obviously, about getting gone to the bathroom on by a big bird and it was a very large bird, and I think that's why there was so much. And I really had fun and I'm gonna go back out to the park later and put out a lot of food for the birds and try to just get them all. Filled and ready to go. So harry's dot com delivers superior shave at an incredible price. They bought this razor factory in Germany and they've been crafting the world's highest quality blades. The starter set is called The Truman. It's a little play on this movie with Jim Carey. And it's a great option for new customers and an amazing deal for fifteen dollars you get a razor handle moisturizing shave cream, if you need that, and three of Harry's five blade German engineered razors. There's a special offer for fans of the show. You get five bucks off with your first purchase with the promo code handbook. Go to harrys dot com right now. Look for the Truman Set. That's h a r r y s dot com. And does this sound good to you. Oh. Oh. Oh. And that is to make the birds think I'm a bird so I can get even closer, so I don't have to wait so to get what I'm looking to get on me on me. Enter the code handbook at checkout and get five dollars off and help support the show and stop compromising. We're sick of you doing that and give Harry's a try today. My name's Hayes Davenport. I'm from Hollywood Handbook. Hollywood Handbook.",
