There's a profile for every guy whether you're looking for clothes for the office, the club, a lazy weekend, whatever, five four has you covered. That for style profiles, classic casual forward mix. They sent us a lot of the clothes and we love the clothes. We wear them all the time. Sean, there's always been a thing with Sean you know, he's, like, tried to start several companies to compete with five four and none of them have been successful. He started a company to sell all the posters that he had made for those other companies, and that didn't go anywhere. And so he he started making the posters and to close which then caused a I think a significant health risk and a lot of people who were potentially buying the posters. I think there were only one or two that actually did it. But all that has kinda fallen apart. Maybe that's why he's not here today. Hang on. Hang on one second. There's somebody at the door.
