And let me tell you what burns my butt about that, not like you don't already know. It's supposed to be my job to do a song about not wanting to buy expensive things. Because black people do it too much. I sang the song called thrift shop where I said, you guys you other guys buy all your fancy clothes and you like riding cool cars and you think that spending money is cool, but it's actually not cool because now white people aren't doing it anymore and we don't like it. So too bad for you, black guys. You tried to be like us, but now We don't pick that expensive things, a jewelry are fun. So you're gonna have to try again. But now Lord is coming along and she's singing the exact exact same song and it's being just as number one as mine was. She sings a song where she says, every song is like Chrystau, Maybacks, diamonds on your timepiece, grey goose, stuff like that, and it's true. Every song is like that. Because that's what black people are singing about. And but my message was, no more singing about that because it's not cool anymore. And now she has the exact same message and white people like it just as much as they like my song, because it's satisfying to them to tell black people that the stuff that they're interested in is not good. I don't even know why I'm telling you this. I just figured that you would understand because we came up with the idea together to write songs about Black conspiracy being wrong and it's not cool anymore. Write me back.
