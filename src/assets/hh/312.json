    "line": "hey, guys. It's Hayes, and I am here to talk about Squarespace. Turn your idea, your great idea. Into a great reality with Squarespace. What we've talked about some issues around Squarespace in the past. It's a great product, like the function it's like easy to use, easy to launch any of your passion projects. A passion project that Sean did launch recently after some of his domains that he had put up there had been seized by different government departments. He had this idea I we've been over this before, but to put, like, basically a blank site up that would give people the functionality to write or draw designs and messages of peace to each other. And he it was called the peaceful Post, and it was just a place where people could on the Internet could relax and be creative and also read other people's messages for inspiration. And the the only person who used it turned out to be someone who just wrote, the doo doo man on it. And Sean went ballistic, and he that, like, tried to find out who it was that wrote the doo doo man. He used some kind of, like, IP tracing technology. I I actually think it was part of the peaceful post that, like, whatever you did on it, it would reveal your location somehow, not just, like, in that moment, but ongoing. I didn't really think that was possible, but So Sean figured out it was the backpack kid. He tried to arrest the backpack kid, but the backpack kid was flossing too hard and too expertly for Sean to get the handcuffs on him. So Sean has decided to destroy the back pack kid by becoming him. He is learning to floss really well and really fast. There has been an issue so far that, like, when he's swinging his arms in the back, he has ended up punching and chopping his butt a lot, to the point of hospitalization multiple times, from just like chopping it too hard and too fast. But he he really is getting good and eventually he is going to build a site that is going to just have the video of him basically being the backpack kid better than the backpack kid ever was. He's working on getting a backpack as well. Right now, he has kind of like a soft placemat that he has, like, folded to create kind of a sack and stapled it to the back of his sure that is, like, creating a pretty good backpack illusion.

I'll just quickly run through some of the history that we have with this service Sean created a website with Squarespace called the peaceful Post that was a blank canvas where people could do designs and ideas and images, promoting peace. And it could be a place where everyone on the Internet came together to get inspired and share their feelings and to come together. Somebody wrote the doo doo man on it. He traced their IP address in a rage and figured out that it was a backpack kid. And then he tried to arrest the backpack kid with handcuffs, but he was doing the floss dance too fast. And so he couldn't get the handcuffs on him. And so he decided to destroy the backpack kid by becoming the backpack kid, but he is doing the floss very fast, but having a hard time coordinating it, so he is not basically beating himself up as he's doing it. This comes to where we are now. He has made a video and posted it on different platforms in order to create a Squarespace site where he is displaying that he himself is the backpack kid who is, like, better at doing it than he ever could be than the original backpack kid ever could be. He does have a new backpack. He used to use a soft placemat with stuff in it. But now he does have a CVS bag that is it's actually so many CVS bags stuffed inside each other that it is basically as thick as a backpack, like indistinguishable from a backpack. However, the hosting platforms that he has hosted the video on have pulled it down. As part of the violation of their codes of conduct related to violence on the site. They don't he's doing it so fast that it actually looks like many fists are, like, physically destroying his butt. And sometimes his sides. And it does basically feel like some sort of violence video that someone has posted as a threat and his butt In a video basically becomes a mess. So right now, it's not available to be seen. But my understanding is that he is still working on it, and he's actually making really good progress on it. Squarespace makes it easier than ever to launch your passion project.

    "line": "Hey, Hollywood Handbook fans. Am I not turtle y enough to join the Turtle Club? Okay. That is a little a bit of a preview for what I'm going to talk about in this ad because Turtle is the rigging company. That's right. Turtle is pronounced as the word turtle even though it's spelled t r t l. Airplanes can be uncomfortable. Actually, I scratched that. Airplanes are usually uncomfortable. That's why Turtle invented the most comfortable travel pillow in the world So Hayes and I both wanted to be part of the turtle club. We've been rejected multiple times. It doesn't seem to matter. How Shell like the backpack we wear is. It doesn't seem to matter whether we get our green face paint just right. They won't let us in and I think it's because we haven't gotten our neck right. Turtle finally came out with a pillow that does get it right. It's a travel pillow scientifically proven to provide better support than the usual u shaped neck pillows. The secret of triple travel pillows is its internal support structure with flexes to support your head and keep you upright. So if you can't picture this, turtle is like a scarf, almost like it's a scarf you put on with like a firm side that you can rest your head against. So when you're on a plane, you wrap that up and then you can lean the weight of your like chin and head into it and it'll support you to give finally podcast listeners like yourself the elusive sensation of having someone's shoulder to rest your chin on when you're on a plane. Obviously, Our audience in particular is made up of a lot of solo travelers. Which is great. We love it. We wouldn't have it any other way. But that said, wouldn't it be nice while you're traveling solo to have your chin and neck supported by something as if you had a partner. So the secret turtle travel pillow I've already told you about. It's patented design fits in neck and shoulder shape. It's proven to work with over a million sold and eleven thousand reviews, the turtle pillows. The most reviewed travel pillow on Amazon. They make it their business to sell your travel hassles with their range of innovative travel accessories for the new Pillow plus to packing pods from the new pillow plus to packing pods in a collection of award winning compression socks available in loads of fun designs. So I got this, and I tried it. And I thought like,",

The it is better than the traditional u shaped travel bill, which I've owned like three of and I just like pay too much for them at the airport and then throw them out because they don't really work. It is actually even better than putting your chin on a person's shoulder which is let's face it unreliable. It straight up works and I am going to use it. What I wanna say is Obviously, it does look weird. It does look stupid. I have two counter points. Everyone looks like shit when they're flying on a plane. It is when you look your worst. So that is okay. Point number two. It only really looks dumb because I've never seen anyone wearing it before. So if everyone listening would buy it and start wearing it, then everyone would have it on. So no one would look dumb. So please do get it. I actually did like it, the turtle billow, and we're in the turtle club now, turtle. Flying can be comfortable thanks turtle and right now you can get twenty percent off at turtle travel dot com. That's t r t l t r a v e l dot com. With the code, the Boys. Use the Boys to get twenty percent off at turtle travel dot com. Thanks for listening to my ad, everybody.",
