Now, I couldn't get enough of the stuff that happened in the movie. Coop was on cruise control and I mean it in the best possible way like speed two. He is at the height of his star power and was able to just sort of hang out in a film with fun people written and directed by the guy who brought you Elizabeth Town, and I don't mean, maybe, maybe.

Did I mention that Krzinsky crackles? I mean, it was so good.
