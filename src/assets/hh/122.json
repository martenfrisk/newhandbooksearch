Super deluxe is a digital video site that huge comedy fans might remember from back in the day? Or they might not. Well, they've returned and they're bigger and better and bigger than ever. And they're making really incredible surreal animation, trippy political edits, compelling new series, music, videos art and unscripted stuff and I'm wondering if some of this. Brink stuff isn't unscripted because the dialogue feels so natural And I'm like, these guys are really inhabiting some of these roles. But here I am falling in love.
