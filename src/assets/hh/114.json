And that they did that about three times in the last half hour of the movie. And we have the part of our mission coming up where we have to do checkpoints and we're very stressed about it because I don't know how we're gonna get through three of them. I don't remember how they got through it. I just remember there was sort of like a ticking clock like oh no, what about the thing when we get to the check point that happened and then immediately happened again and then immediately happened again in that movie and we're afraid that that might happen to us and then happened to us again and then happened to us again.

We're trying to do this super Argo mission in this country where they have a lot of sand. I can't say name on a country, but it's one of the mean ones. And we're trying to do something special and be heroes, and you guys are making it hard because when we ask you a question, you just go, Argo, fuck yourself. And we crack up just as we did when we watched that screener two years ago, maybe three years ago. And so that is fun and we could all use some levity but it also is not great just because what we're dealing with is we might get stopped at a checkpoint, maybe die. And my only hope is that there's one guy who seems really difficult and, like, not on board with the plan, and that he'll step up and be a hero like what? I think happened at the end of the Argo, the original Not the original Argo. The Argo where they were the real Argo where they were pretending to make a movie called Argo that was a fake movie that I guess at one point was a real movie, and it was based on a true story. So, now, we're doing a fake version of that real movie where they were pretending to make a real movie in a fake way.
