Don't drive stoned, especially stoned on trombone. When you're on the bone or any other narcotics, your reaction time slows way down. And you become dangerously hep. Trombone makes you lift right out of your shoes and forget who you are you become only a slave to the bone. If you are driving now and you can feel yourself grooving to the bone, pull over and just ride it out. You may also be afflicted with a condition called Jazma. Stop kidding yourself. If you've been using marijuana or trombone in any form, do not get behind the wheel. If you feel different, you drive different, drive high, get a DUI.",

But the Quip electric toothbrush is one of the most gift guided gifts of the season. Here's why It's perfect for everyone with a mouth, and it's something they'll use twice a day. I do wanna update everyone on my situation that I mentioned in the last ad since using the Quip toothbrush. I have finally been able to be in love with my teeth, but also I do have a yogi bear following me around sort of floating on the smell, the good smell that my teeth are producing. Since I have started using the quip. I have tried a bunch of different toothpaste. It doesn't matter. It's that it's a it is the brush that is making them smell. So NICEen is making yogi bear float around on the smell behind me. I'm currently in my car, and his nose is kind of like bumping against the back of the the car as he sort of follows the smell, it is very dangerous driving because he sort of floats right behind the car. At the speed the car is going in, switching lanes can be very dangerous unless you have like a lot of of clearance. One interesting thing I did some searching around And it doesn't look like Yogi Bear ever did the floating on the smell. In a cartoon. Bugs Bunny did it. I think Mickey Mouse did it a few times, but Yogi Bear never did follow the smell of a picnic basket or of a a pie on a windowsill, he just desired the basket and the pie in a in a grounded way. So this is, I guess, kind of a new thing for him. It's not something that future Quip users have to worry about because he he does seem very attached to to the smell of my teeth. And he's not I don't think he's gonna be following anyone else's teeth anytime soon.",

The from Frozen the Frozen Snowman has has joined him, and he is sort of floating behind us as well. And I asked him sort of what was going on there, not something I associate with him at all floating on the smells, but he, I guess, is obsessed with anything that is icy and fresh. Which definitely is is totally fair. It does describe. My teeth since I started using the quip, and which it also has a multi use cover that mounts to mirrors and unmounts to slide over the bristles. It makes holiday travels clean and easy. It has sensitive sonic vibrations, It's gentle enough for sensitive gums. And better yet, the built in timer pulse is to remind you when to switch sides, and that's my favorite part. That's why I love Quip. And that's why they have over five thousand verified five star reviews. It looks like a big ticket tech gift with a stocking stuff or price starting at just twenty five dollars. If you go to get quip dot com slash the boys right now, you'll get your first refill pack for free with a quip electric toothbrush, but you don't have to tell your gift deed that.

Robinhood is an investing app that lets you buy and sell stocks ETFs, options, and cryptos, all commissioned free. So even if you're a stock market newcomer, you can invest for the first time with true confidence. So Sean is not here this week, This is one of the week where I'm doing all the ads. He told me when I asked if he would help that by the time this episode came out, he would be across state lines on a beach in Waikiki smashing coconuts. I'm not he just sort of left that to me to interpret. But he did wanna announce he doesn't have sometimes he has, like, competing products to the one that we are advertising to try and get a little extra money for himself from them. This time he does not have something that competes with Robinhood, but he has he says invented a new stock and he would like me to sort of tell you guys about it. This is not an endorsement of the stock. I just want you know that this is a stock that exists and you can buy at least, like, certificates of it, like printed certificates that he did that have sort of party hap border, that's kind of fun. The stock is called Klemeron. It is named after the company Enron, which Sean explained to me got a job. I I I'm looking at a he gave me a two certificates, but he ripped one up because of a face I made, he said. But He's a it's a apparently, it is an energy company like Imran. My understanding is that what the company mostly does is it packages, monster energy, and two liter bottles, what they don't currently serve it in. So he says that this is like a a void in the market that he is filling, and he is also filling the bottles. With with with with monster energy. I'm not sure what the bottles used before they don't have any labels anymore. So that's that's something that you can buy. I'm not sure if it's on Robinhood, but Robinhood doesn't charge commission fees, which means you can trade stocks keep all of your profits while other broker just charge up to ten dollars for every trade. And if you're on the web, you can view stock collections like the hundred most popular as well as like entertainment and social media and more curated for categories like female CEOs. Easy to use the app. I've used it. And Robinhood is giving listeners a free stock like Apple Ford or Sprint to help you build your portfolio. Sign up at handbook dot robinhood dot com. That's handbook dot robinhood dot com. Holywood handbook. I have an interesting idea for a new kind of show. Yeah. Where it's normal guys, but it turns out that they are",
