He's wearing like cargo shorts. Reaches in his pocket. Congo shorts. Is that something? He and he and he grabs a twenty and he slides it across the bar. So he's kind of nursing the martini and and the bartenders catering to other customers but checking in with the gorilla every now and then and as the night progresses, they get to talking. And they start to have a really good conversation. It turns out the grill is a hell of a listener and this guy gets into some of what's been going on in his life. You know, he didn't see himself as a bartender, he wanted to be an artist, and he kinda just fell into it, started slinging drinks, and ultimately made enough money to kind of have his own four walls and a roof that that he could call his business and he's proud of it, but it's it's not what he saw from self and, you know, the gorilla listens and he and he has some good advice and some good perspective and and they get to talking about sports, other things, you know, what's what's been going on lately? Do you think the do you think the capitals will win the Stanley Cup this year? Of course, they did.",
