I I mean I I that's that's how I would prefer to go about this. So I'm gonna read the the the the email that I got from from Harry's razors. It says the text that there's no subject, the text is, hey guys, this is Harry's marketing executive, NICE, no beard. And then in parentheses, it says, not my real name, just the name I go by professionally. We like the ads you've done for us pretty good, but wouldn't it be funny? And then there's a paragraph break. If you guys did an ad where it was about the movie, save the last dance but it was shave the last dance. Copy is attached below. Do this or we will sue you. Sorry. So I'm just gonna read the ad copy. It's an r t f file, so I'll open that. It says, Harry's razors presents a good new movie shave the last dance starring Julia hairstyles Shorn Patrick Thomas and Harry Washington. I guess it's Carrie Washington. I didn't know if she was in that movie. But it says the girl in it has trouble shaving her butt, gross. But then she finds a Harry's razors buried in the ground And the guy teaches her how to do it, and they kissed on the lips. There have the price of normal blades and they ship free to your doorstep. That sentence looks like it was pasted from something else. It's in a different font. She doesn't pay thirty two dollars for an eight pack of blades. She only pays fifteen dollars for the Harry starter set and they're made in Germany where Martin Lawrence was born, the end by NICE No beard. So I I have used these razors. I like them a lot. I do not endorse this movie idea. I think it's bad. The razors are good. The movie is bad. But you can get five dollars off your first purchase at harrys dot com entering the coupon code handbook. I'm I'm sorry about NICEy no beard. So lingering after the Deptone show. And Chuck, Close your men. So do you have a light?
