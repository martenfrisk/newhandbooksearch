For over an hour, we talk about his music career songs. He''s released. We talked about his television appearances from the Wire to the brand new show The Deuce and also the debut of Drop the Mic, which is a show that I created and co executive produced on TBS debuts October 24th at 10 30. It''s where celebrities rap battle against each other, and I swear to you, it''s better than that sounds. I promise you that. But listen, you could download our episode now at Apple Podcast's on the Earwolf network and listen to an engaging conversation. Sort of candid. A lot of stuff comes out with literally one of the best rappers in the game. Still, Method Man, We hope you listen and yeah, whatever.
