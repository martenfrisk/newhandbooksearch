Maybe visiting my fucking deadbeat dad in a goddamn hospital where he''s dying of booze and Devon. Now we're getting somewhere, and I'm thinking what a funny comedian and like. And now I'll go see this guy''s movies because, you know, honestly, I did it all on his own, and he overcame so much fucking on one right now.

I feel like I'm talking to debt. Pull over here. Okay? Yeah, baby, It''s true, Devon, But that''s not who walked in the door? No, some some fucking nobody. Yeah, the guy who walked in the door was, um, uh, Greg the Bunny or something. Some character that also was sarcastic but just never took off. Greg the bunny. Oh, Seth Green something. And and so to me, for you to go from Greg the bunny. Yeah, Teoh Deadpool. I mean that in, what, 48 minutes or something? Hopefully les's pretty good. And so I'm thinking, Ah, this guy''s really doing well and I just hate the idea of someone trying to be judged on just their work and things they came up with and then just answering question's honestly and not creating a mythology around themselve's. Because to me, that''s not really showbiz. Isn't Mr No, it''s not. It''s it''s it''s artsy bullshit. Yeah, and I'll tear down those all to comics. It''s fake. Pretentious bullshit.
