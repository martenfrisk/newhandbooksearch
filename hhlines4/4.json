Turn your great idea into a reality with Squarespace, they make it easier than ever to launch your pas'sion project whether you're showcasing your work or selling products of any kind. Obviously, over the last few weeks I've talked about some, uh, not is'sues, but just like experiences that Sean has been having with Squarespace just to quickly recap Ah, he created a site called The Peaceful Post, which was a blank sort of. Can this where people could draw and post ideas about, like, how we could be peaceful with each other. And it would just be a place for everyone on the Internet to share their ideas in drawings. Ah, and somebody wrote the due to man on the page. So it's really just like a white space with someone writing the due to man on it. Ah, and Sean freaked out. And when to find out who it was, he did discover it was the backpack kid. He tried to arrest the backpack kid, but he was doing the flos's dance too quickly. So Sean decided he had to become the backpack kid. He Did posted a YouTube video of him doing the flaw stance, but he was doing it really, really fast and kind of like hitting himself in the but a lot of the time, as his hands were like pas'sing by in the back. Ah, and looked like hurting himself a lot and like causing himself bad, like medical injury. Ah. And so YouTube Did take it down as part of their policy against violence. Ah, and murder. And so Sean s. Oh, that actually takes us to the present day, which is that Shawn is working on starting his own video. Say, obviously, who better to partner for this than Squarespace? Um, there have been a couple false starts on the domain front for him. He tried to buy Squarespace dot com slash youtube, but that is apparently not how it works. Not ah, wow, That''s their site. Still basically, um, Then he tried to do a thing where he would get you tub. Not even you tub dot com. I think just you tub. But he would write a program where when you typed that in, like pos'sibly on your way to type YouTube, it would. The program would automatically go to his different site. So It would basically create a trapdoor in the U. R L Field on the way to YouTube and effectively disable all of YouTube''s power. And no one would really even be able to reach it anymore because of this trapdoor. Ah, the browser software companies have not been flexible on that. They won't let him write this program for the browser software. Um, and he did go around each of them personally and brought fluid what he described as fresh food toe have meetings with them. Ah, but they still were not interested in this concept or or the meeting s. Oh, now the work begins. I'm told on building a browser that will allow him to do the trapdoor or pos'sibly even have a very small U. R L bar that has a six character limit. So YouTube would not even actually be allowed in the U. R L Bar. Also, he has not yet been able to erase where it says the do do man on the peaceful post. So do not go to the peaceful post right now. Ah, wait until under. Like in the new browser, he feels like hell be ableto have that flexibility. So just wait until the new browser is finished and then you will be able to go to Utah and you will be able to see the peaceful post. It will all be on this new browser with beautiful templates and the ability to customize just about anything. You can easily make a beautiful website yourself.
