It's Sean from Hollywood Handbook, one of your best friends, and I am closer to you than your family cam blogger sandwich. I'm here to talk about with you, and the Blue Apron is a company and they're doing two ads, so the show has, ah, add sponsor and their names Blue Apron, and they're doing the ad for the show. You can do your own foods. It doesn't always have to be a restaurant or your mommy cooks for you. Now you can also go in the kitchen or start a fire. Do it on any property or any park you want because the beef is humanely raised. So what is it about Blue Apron that makes me want? You did know about it? Well, there''s only $10 per meal that it''s les's than and they're going to give you the seasonal recipe. Proportion ingredients make delicious home cooked meals. And again, I said you could cook it in a park. So one thing that I do need to tell you is the highest quality standards for artisanal suppliers is set by Blue Apron and make it conversational. Make this your own one. Farming practice that could be used is regenerative farming, and Blue Apron is doing that. So when the meals have paprika, spice shrimp, cheddar grits and tomato sweet corn, you gotta know that you could make this a ham blucher sandwich and the way to do it is Get a bread and another side and smash in So just imagine the spicy hoisin smash chicken stir fry Squish in between baby bok choy Sesame ginger cucumber salad with the bread on both sides Hamburger sandwich The eggplant and chickpea T gene with islander pepper.
