[{"line":"It's an ad, and it''s the Clem dogs. So low style. So, you know, it''s gotta be good. First, let me addres's the sound quality of the ad. Okay, You're wondering Hey, Sean didn't Earwolf send you, like, really expensive nice sound equipment so that you would have good sound quality when you recorder episode's and ads from home. Yeah, actually, they did. But the product I am about to tell you about is actually located on my phone, and I use it so much, it''s got me addicted to my phone so that I can't put it down. So yeah, I'm recording this one from my phone so that I can click out of the ad, which I don't even really want to do because I'd rather be using the app. I can go straight back to the app and the app is called Fit bod fit bod. Sean, that sounds like you. Yeah, I know. If you've gone to the gym without a plan. You know how overwhelming the weight room can feel. I certainly have been lost, confused and often will spend two or three hours in the gym and leave without having done a single workout, because I just kind of went and looked at the machines and couldn't make heads or tails of the pictures they had on them. Fit Body is a smart fitnes's app that takes the gues'swork out of planning your workouts, their algorithm factors in your goals, experience level equipment, workout duration and muscle recovery to craft the perfect total body workout program just for you. Now this is true. I actually have used the APP, and if you do not want a total body workout program, if what you want is to focus on a single muscle, specifically, the muscle that connects from it''s like next to like the bottom of the six pack, and it goes in sort of points down towards like day. Weve talked about this muscle before. Um, anyway, you can select that it''s they have little photos of muscle groups, and you can point on that one and say, Give me this with each workout. The Apple earned your abilities and plans workouts designed to maximize your result's. It''s perfect for anyone who''s looking to get better fitnes's result's with your goal. The general fitnes's, strength training, muscle tone, bodybuilding, powerlifting or, in my case, Olympic weightlifting. If you have equipment, great. If you don't know equipment, theyve got body weight routines. This is something I want to say about the app, something I do like about it. I have pretty limited equipment. What I have is to paint cans. Well, really three, but one I want. I don't want to touch cause it''s got other stuff on it. But I have to paint cans and I do have a um it''s like a bike tire, but it has wings if that makes sense and those I havent seen them featured on the Apple. Any pictures? But sometimes I will pretend that the pain can is like a dumb bell and that the tire with wings as like a resi'stance band of some kind and when they do suggest, uh, work out to me that I can't do with my current materials. You can hit, replace exercise and scroll through, and itll give you something that you can do with what you have, be it paint cans. Or if what you have in your house is like a you know, just, uh, what would be in your house like a you would have in your house. I know there''s a good opportunity roast you.
