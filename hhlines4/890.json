Uh, earlier in this episode, we had an advertisement for internet dot b s are where it was ostensibly Rebecca Lobo, the former basketball player from a WNBA endorsing internet dot bs on behalf of Hollywood Handbook. That was not Rebecca Lobo. That was me. Uh, she was alerted to this discrepancy, I guess, between when the payroll aired and, uh, and now, um, she visited me in my home. Ah, and she kind of stuffed me into a back basketball shape and she dunked me into a trash can. Uh, and I have to stay a basketball for the rest of my life on, and she she is still here. What she wants me to communicate is the internet dot b s is not. This was all me Internet internet dot bs should not be responsible for this mistake. Mistake.

I go to internet dot bs backslash Hollywood Handbook right now show the world that you mean business with the slam dunk dot business. Sorry. No slam dunk thing. There's no sorry dot Biz domain name for just $6. Hey, handbook heads. Here comes Sean Clemens with an ad from our sponsor, Casper mattresses and look out and duck, cause I'm coming in strong. It's an obsessively engineered American made mattress at a shockingly fair price, and now you can get even better price. It's $50 toward any mattress purchase, and you go to Casper dot com slash handbook and you use the code handbook. And that's how you do it. No. Why do you want this mattress in particular? Okay, I'll tell you, because you're one of my best friends.

I know what that does that protects me from liquids. So then I'm here, and that's in a mattress. Is this mattress like, made for people pee their beds like like they're a little kid? Yes, it ISS. That's how that that is. Who can use this mattress? It doesn't say in the ad. Copy that that's exclusively who it's for. And you probably could sleep on it, too, and should, if you're a normal guy, are like normal is the wrong word, but if you don't like, piss your bed when you're asleep. But if you do, you don't even have to tell me. But just you could buy this mattress and it says, Got latex in it. So that's got to be good, right? Look, guys, you spend about a 30 year life sleeping, and I believe my rough estimate is you spend about 3/4 to almost yeah, 3/4 to 80% of your life going to the bathroom. It's obviously gonna have some overlap. Were part of the time that you spent go. The bathroom is also the time, especially, but there's nothing wrong with that. So, like if you're doing that, get the frickin mattress that says Bright and it's got latex, that's it's right there for you. They got a risk free trial and return policy theyll delivered straight to you. You could try for 100 days and like if you go to a normal store, right, you get to land their matches for a minute. And if you happen, I have to go to the bathroom during that time to get so mad. Like, really, it's kind of out of proportion with the problem. I think that some of the employees at Sears or whatever if you're in one of their mattresses there, just like Wiggin out, I'm like, Dude, relax. When you be more like Casper, let me have it for 100 days and then I can, like, switch it out for a fresh lot or just return it. But why would I return it? It's got latex foam, and that's whats great. It's $500 for a twin size mattress and 9 50 for a king size mattress, which, if you compare that to industry averages at the places where they're really rude to you, uh, it's like This is a better price and you get $50 towards any mattress purchased by going to Casper dot com slash handbook and using code handbook. Terms and conditions apply. So whether you're a normal guy or a guy who has to pee when you're sleep, it's Ah, the mattress for you is the one that C. A S P E.
