And then you know how he gets. Yeah. Yeah. And so I'm like, Dr Dre, I'm in the middle of a meeting on and, uh and I'm in there, and I'm with Ice Cube and D o C and Eazy E and Sue d o double G and the group that said Mullah Book The police? Yeah, And they said that Yes, Yes, I'm just saying I'm not approving Night If I Were You s. Oh, so that's who''s in the meeting with me and he''s waving around this paper and he''s screaming and he''s like, I just read my new verse and you guys got me saying that I taught everyone how to smoke trees and he''s and he''s upset. Yeah, because he doesn't know how to smoke trees. Yeah, he''s going like, what if someone asked me about it? And I think that Well, yes. So it''s so here. So now I got this whole group of guys. So it''s me. It''s no GI docs Ice Cube, Eazy E. It''s groups of motherfucking police. And weve got to teach him how to smoke trees, Doctor, so that he feels comfortable doing the verse, The ways, just outside of the fact that we didn't say we don't have him saying I taught you to smoke. We're having to say, Hey, who do you think taught you to smoke trees? So there is so well. But I do think some people at the time not everyone knew how, and so people were approaching him, saying, Please teach me to smoke trees and and he didn't. Nobody has to pretend that he did s so it was a lot of people who were smoking it by like just burning up the whole thing. No, I know well. And when? And as we're trying to teach us, like setting the entire teach him in my office on the fire, the smoke alarms going off because he''s sticking in his ear. He''s got the wrong on a tree. There''s Keith everywhere and kind buds. I'm I'm so freaked out and and he''s got my nicest Tomahawk bubbler. And I'm just thinking this guy''s gonna drive todo Oh, yeah, what is that thing? Sticking his tongue in the carb and it''s everything. And I'm so annoyed. And I'm like, Hey, we just ask you, toe posit the question. Who do you think taught you to smoke? I said, Hey, I still gotta work on Marshall''s verse, you know? So I don't neces'sarily have time for this. I know I've got I'm still local enough to choke you to death with the Charleston, too, but I don't know where it goes from there. Like, I think that''s all I have. And so the whole time we're teaching you to spoke trees now, Ultimately, we did smoke trees. It did inspire me, you know, And I did wind up coming up with some killer stuff in that verse about Mercedes Benz with those up, the tent goes up to mid eighties. But it''s but at the time, I was very nervous just because of the deadline. Hey, welcome, Hollywood Handbook Kicking butt drug dropping Manning''s carpet line foul.
