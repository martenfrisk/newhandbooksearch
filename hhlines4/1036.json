Before we do it, it's going to go by so fast, We, uh, people have maybe been noticing Sean and I doing a lot of guest's again. Having trouble? Not trouble? No, but trouble meeting people. And it s so hard with all these, especially now lines, Especially now and in L. A. To meet people really face to face one were in Our little pods arent we are little vehicle. We're all in our cars. And then when we get out of the car, what do we look at a screen And you go up in it with a ragging, a spray bottle, trying to meet someone at their car? Yeah, and they and just to talk. And if they and if they got a couple bucks on him, great. But that''s not why you're doing it. You're just doing it right away and saying, Let''s talk nice windshield. You shouldn't be free. Mrs. Idle doesn't make sense because I see I'm paying for the material. So we had it. The idea to say, Where are the where is a celebrity? To be a guest, to be a gues's. Who''s talking? Yes, to your face? Yes.

Not just a movie but a project. Yes, when it's time to do any pride, any project. Yes, that''s right. The people of the project gather in in a big room. Ah, and they talk todo journalism. Mm. They talked the newspaper. They talked to the magazine then and the Internet. They talked to the Internet and the TV show. Yeah, everyone guns. And it''s called pres's junket Any YouTube? It's name is pres's junket. And so when he's tells me this, my job just about hit the floor because what I'm seeing is I read it in the magazine idea. Uh, and if we can go and get at a pres's junket, we're meeting people where celebrity guest's are talking to us. We bring the microphones, we bring the engineer, we bring Chef Kevin. Then we have the show. We're doing the show at the pres's drunk. And what if they can't leave such a big advantage over the way that we have normally done? This podcast is we do not have to explain what the show is and presented to them as an option to do or not do. It was you there, and we do not get to make them comfortable at all before we start the show. We're just We just start doing it. We are in. We just go, baby. So he went to the hotel. Ah, And we asked about what if there were if they were doing any of these today, and they said no. Uh, they have to say that. Yes, but then we forgot about it for a long time, and then we just happen to be there for something else. USA Today? Yes, It comes to the hotel. Yes. We were going to, like, read our favorite newspaper. Would you don't have to stay in the hotel to do, you know, just cause it''s in the lobby. Yes, Uh, and I remember just said off the top my head like, Hey, are you doing pres's drunk it today? And they said, Yes. The tick is upstair's. If they have to tell you if they have one, yes, it''s entrapment. If they don't on. I'm like What? Who is that? Yeah, well, because it''s traditionally bugs. Yes, and they the hotel person explained to me that they know about every show And they said the tick is this guy, this famous guy, and this is so quick were saying this really quickly. Just really, for people who feel there was this, like, it''s Yeah, uh, he''s this famous guy, and he has this little friend. Yeah. So I said, I gotta talk about how to at least look at him. That''s my favorite. Now I said yeah, remember? No, because the guy sort of made this face at Hayes. That suggested. Okay, you didn't know what the tick is. Are you allowed to even be in this pres's junket? And he's then went, sir, and he''s holding the guy''s shirt sleeves.","id":"qxHWLXMByMrymAEmMtsP","index":"handbook","podcast":"Hollywood Handbook","episode":"Peter Serafinowicz and Griffin Newman, Our Junket Friends","speaker":"spk_0","timeCode":292.67,"tags":["YouTube","Chef","Kevin","ju'st","ju'st","USA Today","ju'st","Haye"]},{"line":"You said Peters.
