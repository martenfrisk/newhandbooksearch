Ah, I just Ah, I am actually adding new elements to the pillow. I thought it could be really interesting to have this mouse of a mouse on it. That's sleeping. And to have so so the mouse is dreaming of a piece of cheese. Ah, and then I was a come. What would the cheese dream about? And so the cheese, you know, there''s like a little dreaming bubble from the cheese, and the cheese is dreaming about some cut up apples. That would be that it wants to be, like combined with ah, and then the cut up apples are dreaming about Steve Jobs because of Apple computer. Ah, Steve Jobs is dreaming about computer, and so, like it just it kind of continues in this chain all the way around the pillow. Everyone, everything is dreaming about something else, which is true. Ah, and then it loops back around like I accidentally ran out of space. And so I have a baseball bat that is dreaming about the mouse because that''s just like when it looped around. There wasn't enough room to put another thing in between. So I decided, I gues's, figure out a story for why that would be happening. Uh, guys, the easie'st way to ease back into a post summer routine simplified the morning and evenings with an electric toothbrush from Quip times. Sonic vibrations offering effective clean. That''s gentle on your sensitive gums in just two minutes, twice a day. So I gues's this is that''s, like, one way to do it, for sure. Uh, for me, this is the time of year, end of September, like after I have gone back to school for a couple weeks. This is when I will do all my tooth brushing for the entire year. I I will just carve out a week. I will not go to school. Ah, and just get it all done. So two minutes a day, twice a day. Ah, that''s Ah, four minutes a day, times three and 65. So I will basically just brush my teeth for over 1000 minutes. Ah, and that saves me. I feel like from having to, like, go like, Oh, I'm doing something else. Oh, no, I got to go brush my teeth. It''s like actually making the time for this very important thing. Ah, but just like doing it all at once. And I always rent a place I would like go up the coast and I want to place and I brush my teeth for over 1000 minutes. Ah, and the moat to use cover works as a stand and mounts to Miers putting brushing front and center in your bathroom. So obviously, if you do it the way I do it, you do not need to be reminded throughout the year with the stand or whatever, You can basically put it away until next year. Better yet, the lightweight compact design means you can bring it along with you on those last summer weekend getaways, so that is useful to May and brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just $5 making it easy to stay committed to your oral health. I don't need them. I love Quip. I love the toothpaste. I I love that. It tells me when I'm done brushing good products, and that''s why I love Quip and why it''s perfect for getting back into a routine Quip starts in just $25. If you go to get Quip dot com slash The Boys right now, you can get your first refill pack for free. That''s your first refill pack for free at g et qu dot com slash The Boys Way.
