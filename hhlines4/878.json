And then the actual nudie street kernel of New York got mad and he tried to send the army to beat us up. And then we found out that the new street Colonel New York doesn't have that many friends in the army. And the army was actually doing that. We were the cool ones, and they don't like him s So we were talking to some of our new army friends the other day at the Army. Me and John went there on they offered to go punch a new streak around New York for us on, and we were like No, like that's all over with. It is just about that, like this is all over a T shirt company, even though the T shirts are really good and you get one every month for only 30 bucks, even though they normally cost 100 bucks in the store. And they have different kinds, like Henley''s and be next inside the teachers. They're good, but we don't want anyone to be punched over it. But the Army members, the guys who participate in the Army, were sort of riled up at that point, and one of them did go up to the new street Colonel New York and not punch him, but kind of motion his face like put his whole hand on his face and mush it backwards. And the news reader of New York fell back right in front of a tank that was exploding, and the the tank blew a hole in his hair like right through his hair. And it''s very hard to explain, but he had. This still has this very kind of high hair. It''s not like a beehive, but it, like, kind of piles up in this very unusual way.
