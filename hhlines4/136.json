Ah, One thing we do remember is that it was very, very tense trying to get to the front of the line for, like a checkpoint and that they did that about three times in the last half hour of the movie. Um, and we have the part of our mis'sion coming up where we have to do checkpoints, and we're very stres'sed about it because I don't know how we're gonna get through three of them. I don't remember how they got through it. I just remember there was sort of like, a ticking clock like, Oh, no. What about the thing when we get to the checkpoint? Yeah, that happened and then immediately happened again and then immediately happened again in that movie. And we're afraid that that might happen, tow us and then happened to us again and then happened again. And so we're feeling very scared. Um, we have tried to get in touch with some of the people who did that movie, Uh, but really all of them while weve gotten back, is they are still saying, Argo, fuck yourself. That's very funny to them. You have is funny to me too. And I have been laughing, but I've also been trying to tell them Hey, we really need help. We're trying to do this super Argo mis'sion in this country where they have a lot of sand that can say name a country. But it''s one of the mean ones, and they were trying to do something special and be heroes. And you guys are making it hard, because when we ask you a question, you just go, Argo, fuck yourself and we crack up just as we did when we watched that screener two years ago, maybe three years ago. Um And, uh so that is fun. And we could all use some levity, but it also is not great just because what we're dealing with is we might get stopped at a checkpoint, maybe die. And my only hope is that there''s one guy who seems really difficulty and, like not on board with the plan and that hell step up and be a hero. Like what I think happened at the end of the argo. The original, Not the original Argo, the Argo, where they were the rial Argo where they were pretending to make a movie called Argo. That was a fake movie that, I gues's at one point, was a real movie. And it was based on a true story. So now we're doing a fake version of that real movie where they were pretend to make a real movie in a fake way. So anyway, that''s all the news from the Super Argo front.
