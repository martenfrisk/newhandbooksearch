But he''s usually not doing that s so then does that make him away? I think Sam, I would say, is normally a whack. But when we help him hey, could be looking like when we sort of fix his posture a little bit and have him, you know, kind of squeezes frontal to repeat us together because remember, save the marrow. Yeah, I remember safe Harrys plank. Sure about that. The dude destroyed his voice. He fucked up his throat or whatever. Who? The girl From it had a lady singer away. Ah. Okay. What''s the band? I'm thinking Off Veruca Salt saves the day or something. So that was snacker whack, right? Are we doing another? Do you guys want? I mean, do you like that? Because it is the thing you kind of brought me in to help you out with segments. Yeah, you're paying me an exorbitant really didn't. And so I just want to say, do you want any notes on what we just did? Or do you just Do you feel comfortable with how that went about? You won't tell us why it was good. Well, okay. Here''s what was good about it. Yeah. Is that gonna name it? Felt The okay. The name is good. It''s the name of one of our segments. I would say it''s maybe a little bit confusing because it''s such a long road From snacker wack in terms of a snack that we review on Doughboys is like, Oh, this is this is a food stuff so you can come very easily see the connection whereas snack calling a person of snack if they're attractive or calling them whack if they're unattractive, it seems you think it only works with chicks. Well, well, here''s Here''s the Here''s where was going. Okay, here''s what I'm hearing me on two friends. I'm hearing that when we use a sort of urban Pat wa and someone is looking like it back, Nick is saying that''s not anguish. If you're gonna live in this country, you have tow speak the king''s English, The From addiction area that took away. If you're gonna describe so one is looking like a stack, it has got a chick. I think I just that''s interesting. I just want to clarify. I think I think it''s going to my bigger is'sues that it seems mean spirited to judge someone on their appearance alone and then to make them like to order them to contort their body in a specific way. Like I feel like what you did to Sam was a little demeaning was against you looking like a chicken, like having him look a little more like a like a sexy stack is demeaning because it makes him look more feminine. I think I'm actually only have to conform to traditional gender roles and just have there have a chest look a certain way all the time. How a man should look that thing that''s starting to seem bad to me, Nick. I don't think you want to be out in front of this opinion, So to summarize what Nick''s saying, I just feel like because Sam, real men in a position where you guys air got a higher status than him. He might feel compelled Audio. Got it, cause I don't even see all that. I think about that way that oh my God, and work properly in a workplace equals who Both, you know, okay, have a role to play in the podcast, right?
