And a lot of them are struggling with their relationship with their father, and they kind of got something to prove. Yeah, you know, it''s I mean, and I would be involved with casting. I feel like if you misca'st something like this, it just feels like a lot of actors playing rollers that don't like each other. And we want people to know that these rollers do love each other. Why?
