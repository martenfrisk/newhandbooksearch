Okay, they support the podcast, but they don't neces'sarily support all of our ventures. Right? Because if you heard my last ad and apparently Squarespace did, I was using the Squarespace technology in order to build a new website that would be sort of like a plug in on ESPN dot com, which is me and he's site. Every sports plus news, the spinning wheel and captains will. It's a captain''s wheel that you click on, and then you're the captain and you take over and you can build a site, and it''s it has beautiful templates created by world clas's designer's. It''s totally easy to turn your idea new new and unique website. You can focus your work blogger published content, even sell product or service of all kinds of just a few clicks, customized everything From look and feel to settings and products. And it''s all optimized for mobile. Right out of the box is actually only true of Squarespace. That was not gonna be true of mine. You were never gonna do that. I just didn't know do that. But I was doing the rest on Sean Space, which was the captain''s wheel. And so Squarespace heard our last ad. Yes, and they have been going in at night. Whenever I go to sleep every night, every single night and they take apart Sean space, they destroy it. Then they leave the pieces on the ground. And, yes, so they know where to be thrown out. Yeah, I have to start over crafting new pieces. And so when I wake up, I rebuild it and I watch it. I stay and watch all day, and then when I fall asleep, if I owned a taking a micro nap or whatever they do, come in when I'm asleep. Like Freddy Krueger. And they destroy Yes, they ruin the site. So it''s a good busine'ss model for them, you know? Ah, you Squarespace is analytics to help you grow in real time on your side. And there is nothing to install, patch or upgrade ever. That''s true of Squarespace. That was not gonna be true, Sean Space. Ah, there would be stuff to install, patch and upgrade. Always. But so Squarespace is a little ahead of me on that, which is like then why you have to go destroy my just let you do it. If it''s that as good, that should be good for about Yeah, but they know because they know I'm breathing down their net. Ah, dreams. Just a great idea that doesn't have a website yet. And that''s and he's talk about one of your dreams that you've had. Well, okay, so here''s what I think we can do for the end with the Boys. Yeah, it''s like, Yeah, I had a dream. Or maybe Kevin, you should do it. Do it, Kevin, Because well, like, acted out. Yeah, and you're, like, about to check out. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You had a dream that you're checking out at the counter for your website. Yes. So I had this dream last night that you know, is about to check out your accurate now. But you were at Squarespace dot com for a free trial and don't, like, say it like like you're describing what''s happening, actually, take me into the dream. Yeah, and then when you're ready to launch is when we're talking about OK, so you close your eyes and bad you open your eyes and your at this like what looks like a grocery store. But it actually says Squarespace dot com. Yeah, that''s fun. A grocery store in on the shelves is like website. It''s like different website's. Mia. And you grab your website from one of the shelves, you walk over to the cashier and you say hi, I'm ready to check out. I'm ready to launch reddish Watches. Yeah. Yeah.
