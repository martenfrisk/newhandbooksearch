So by the time I'm like I'm punching, I'm already kind of touching them. So I do descend up giving them a mighty push, and mine went right by them intentionally. I have just laser accuracy with punches and the wind of the punch sort of made them go like, Whoa, yeah, I tried to table top them, like get underneath them on my hands and knees and then you guys were gonna push them. But I I think I thought I told Hayes to do it. The thin haze thought I told Sean to do it, so I just got behind that. Actually, you were in front of them, and I did.

And now jails even more fun than free. And so now freedom. People in freedom are saying, Hey, we actually want Thio have their ear up against the wall of the listening and they're turning out going like it sounds like they're really having fun in there.

Yeah, dangers launches of the new Hollywood Handbook. Really, The way people talk about it, the momentum is very scary to me of that trip. Yes, People love it, and it seems like they're still working pretty hard on it. And they're building like, a whole world. And I used to think, Well, thank God it''s behind a pay well pay wall, because otherwise it would have crushed us. And now it feels like we're entering their territory. Watches. Very stupid idea. Yeah. And so weve gone in the jail, and then the biggest guy and the jail is already running the place, and he''s probably gonna start beating us up pretty fast. I work on that show. Do you want me to, like, send them a mes'sage? Yeah. Have Offices. Gues's I've said this directly to them. Okay, I said this directly to that. Have us is. Gues's it''s now starting to feel pretty personal. It''s a to this point. It is so insulting that I I'm not sure I could ever do it, because I'm worried that I'll go on there and be insulted even more. Yeah, and actually cut me, saying have us is gues's because I actually have said it to them a few times. And I've done it in sort of a light hearted way of like a you know if you ever need a guest, But now it actually does hurt my feelings. And it definitely is something they know that they could do, which is have me as a guest. And they have made a pretty clear choice not to do it. And they have guest's all the time. And so they don't like something about that. I gues's they could say have the rest of us on your show. I only know two of them. I only know two of them.
