Hayes was one of them. Excuse may please refer to buy new stage name. I forgot. My name is and mores backdoor his way into the list. So, um, so now and more got contacted by Josh because Tony had requested him. Um, And then, uh, and Mawr did this episode where they did a song, and it''s like it says, you know, here the podcast is funny, but the songs are legit. I, of course, wouldn't know I was not on the list of comedians that Tony wanted to work with. I was not one of the people that Josh reached out to. Didn't even know about this show until my friend and more told me that he was doing it. So I get him not being happy to not be included in the list 12 hours out of my week to do the show. Imagine not being you had asked to be a part of the show. Oh, I gues's what I'd say is that when I went to Josh, it''s a hey, Josh. Why Did you ask Hayes to do it? His name is and more now and not may you? Josh''s respon'se was Hey, that''s just what Tawney wanted. I mean, she told me who she wanted to work with. Don't say that. Our, like a producer like, don't just put it on. Take the bullet, Josh. Say But say this. And this is for all producers for anything. Listen up when you get confronted. Hey, how come he asked my co host, who I'm inseparable from it within this network. Ah, and not me. Thank you. Say this se. Oh, yeah. It was just an order thing. Like the way we reached out to him first. But we know we had a whole list of people were only doing six episode's for now, but we definitely want it. We want to do one with you. Is just like she wanted to. Each of you individually kick the fucking can down the road. Don't be like this person doesn't like you. I could gues's that that''s what I think happened. I didn't think that she asked for me and you said no. But here''s my gues's. I think it''s the opposite of that I don't I think Tani does like you. I think she was like, Should we get like Earwolf? People do should get Hayes and Sean to do it. And judges like Osho. It could be a little prickly. Would sometimes like you think Josh actually did Knicks. It''s such a big time investment. I don't know if Sean is the best candidate for it. Let''s do a so it''s too haste for now. Um, but at least you know, at least I would say Make me a promise for down the road that you don't have to deal with for like, another year until the next season comes out and I go, How come I didn't get asked this time?
