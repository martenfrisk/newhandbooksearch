You know, uh, yeah, but he's he's a drummer. Yeah, well, that's what I learned in the story. And I hit the skids so hard. Did you calm skins? The skin, the skin skids? Yeah. Yeah, because I've heard them called Skins before. And I guess I assume that's what you said. Well, I mean, I've I've heard that, too, but I'm not calling him. Adam called him skin.

Whats the problem? I can't read this anymore. You serious to things that were missing from your old draft action sex? This scene has both. Yeah, look, it sounds. It's exciting, Like there's a lot of stakes to the scene. Okay, just from an academic screenwriting perspective, it's all there. Okay, But personally, for me, it's hard to read this stuff well. And I think we hear a lot about how there's sort of a double standard with nudity and film and that women get exploited and you don't really get to see Big juicy man mead. Ah, blasting all over. Ah, another dude. Yeah, and And so we thought, Lets strike a blow for equality. But on our terms Exactly, maam responded to those audiences concerns, you know? What do you mean?

See, this is well, you saw Well, that's Yeah, Well, yeah, I think it's a stretch to say that this is a gender issue. You know that? That that this was trying to confront some sort of, well, female gender? I would I would at least hope that you copped to the fact that this is directed at me and that this is almost on intimidation measure to get me toe sign over the rights to the slide. Just because we need E in the script is humiliated, gets jerked off on and then murdered because he won't sign over the rights of the script. And hell wants to involve the WG, Eh? Like some kind of fucking weakling. Yes, yes, that's that's I don't see the parallel discussed man. Do you know not a no man? No. No, you don't see any parallel. My dad has cancer. That's what I'm texting you about. That's what I'm That's the big thing going on in my life right now. You guys right now, I think probably want me to sign over the rights. The screenplay agree that I won't arbitrate with the WG, Eh? Just like a similar document. What? Sean made me sign for the 75 25 split we have in our salary. Now. Now this may seem odd. I guess that I was so against Guzman had bringing up your dad at the previous scenes that I had written him into this later seed. Yeah, the reason I was upset that's cause me and improvised that about your father is only because it's supposed to be a reveal in the film. I thought that we would have used him to leverage you. I here I thought it was moral outrage on my behalf. Yes, I understand why it may be felt that way at the time. But you just want Teoh play with the podcast going into that area that it deceived a little too kind of ghoulish even for us. But that's not the case, because I wanted it to be even worse later. And that is why I was upset. And I just want to make that point now, because you at the beginning it seemed like you didn't want anything in the area of cancer. Just that that to me, that's not even really a joke, that it's just like dark and gross for dark and grosses sake. But actually, I just thought there was a more effective way to do it, which is that? I guess we are turned on by your dads dead body, which weve dragged out to show you when we're holding you over the cliff by your throat and masturbating on you. And we wanted to be clear that what is arousing us to the point where we are capable Just polluting under your face is that we have your dads carcass next to us on the rocks at the edge of the cliff. And you were just upset. That's Kezman kind of tip that Well, it is not a good storytelling and scuzz man, you know, better wanting to introduce that line. Sorry, man, I'm just really excited about where weve taken this script. You know, I'm just I'm just like I mean, I just It's just been with working with you, you know, we cracked it open like an egg way. Didn't get to that joke. No, we didn't wind up saying it in the scenes that we read, but it is on basically every page and usually more than butts way. Just skipped over that we just got lucky, I guess. Yeah, we sort of cherry picked the scenes to somehow avoid that Well, look, I mean, obviously you guys, can you guys know I'm not happy about it. Munn, if you really want me to sign over my claim to the screenplay, I will. You know, it's Ah. Oh! Oh, jeez, I guess. Ah, Scotsman, Did you even I mean, we werent even thinking that, but because, I mean, would you be cool with that? Yeah. I mean, you werent even thinking that. No, I havent had that. I didn't. But, man, if you're cool with that, I guess wed let him do it. I'm Yeah, I'm super cool with that man. I mean, because it's kind of Oh, scuzz man. Heres the keys to my place, you know?
