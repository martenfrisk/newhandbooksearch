Uh so this weekend is the Now Hear This fast in Anaheim on, and we're doing our Hollywood Handbook-East Saturday the 29th which is the major night of the fast with WTF and super ego. And how did this get made? And you could still get tickets and Now Hear This fast dot com use code Handbook-East get 25% off a three day pas's. I say we I really I do think Sean is going to do it right now. He is saying that he has something else to do that weekend. Um, I've talked about how he is not happy that the festival is in Anaheim because he has this pre existing is'sue with Disney Land based on some things that have been there 30 35 years ago. So he right now wants me to announce that he has a competing event that weekend that he wants to promote. Sean has for Halloween constructed sort of a parity haunted house in this some underground parking structure called Disea'se Neiland. That's like a twisted, scary version of Disneyland. But he says it, like isn't even a scary is the rial Disney Corporation and some of the stuff they do. But, um, he''s got rides like these parody rides. He''s got something called the Tower of Terrorism, which is an office chair that you sit on, and somebody dres'sed up like Buzz Lightyear, wearing a turban and, like covered in oil, makes the chair like posed the lever and make the chair descend quickly. They kind of like surprise's you. I did previews things past weekend, so, um, I did the right. He''s got a parody of the Indiana Jones ride called Indian a free state of Jones because he saw Free State of Jones last weekend. He was really into it. So it''s somebody. It''s Sean dres'ses free save jobs, and he''s like freeing a bunch of women from a car. It''s not really a ride, I gues's. And then he''s got a Space Mountain parody that, uh, he calls Disgrace Mountain where you go and, uh, this room, this kind of like outdoor shed but it's indoor and it''s inside is somebody dres'sed like Donald Duck using a toilet made of money. I don't really know what how that''s a Space Mountain parody, but so anyway, Sean says Now to go to Disney disea'se. Neiland instead of the Now Hear This. Fast, he says, is cheaper but is not really think. It''s like 80 bucks. And he does not know about the Banksy Disneyland, things that please do not tell him about.
