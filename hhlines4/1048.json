Ah, along with Squarespace called Sean Space that has had a number of different like purpose's over the years. I don't really remember what any of them were neces'sarily, but most recently so he realized that he had this space that was mostly not like Web developed. It was like white, like a white page. And he said, Hey, this is like a canvas for, like, painting. It's white in that same Away. And so what if this were a space Sean? Space for the entire Internet to come and, like, do design's and expres's themselve's and like, right ideas. And it, like, could be a space where, like everyone on Internet, could kind of come together and create this incredible like a mural of ideas and drawings. And it could be this way well understand each other a little better. Ah, and it could be a way to get a piece. And so he advertised.
