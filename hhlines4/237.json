Let me think. There's really only one thing that''s aunt right, which is I love HH, although you're even at wrong about that. Because if you love a change, you do really care about Shawn''s take on film because the whole fucking show is just my fucking take on Hayes''s tank on fucking media and television and film and Hollywood and actors and people in the entertainment industry and the way they behave, and that is what HH is. So basically, you either do love HH or you don't really care about Shawn''s take on film. And maybe you don't care about my take on film because you just wanted to put out your take on film and have your little moment where you get to feel like Sean Hollywood. Hamburg could get to tell everybody what he thinks about the different things easy, and you're gonna now be this smart guy. It actually know what''s really going on in Midnight special, and that you actually have to admit in your review that everyone agrees the film lose's your words a little when it gives away some of the early mystici'sm. Well, the whole fucking first half of the movie is just handed on you being curious about the early Mrs um and the color and all that, and it es'sentially is just the audience, sort of putting together the puzzle pieces of trying to figure out exactly what''s going on. And my experience was as soon as I had gotten the edges of the puzzle in place. I found out that the entire center of the puzzle was just one big piece that got dropped in in a moment. But I still had to sit there and look at the finish puzzle for another hour and 20 minutes. So my experience at the film was not that enjoyable, but you liked it. So I gues's you are the person who does have a take on film we all need to Hear. And, ah, is it true? I gues's that comedians don't make good critics. Is that a good characterization to make that entire profes'sion would make good critics? Ah, profes'sion, who basically on Lee thinks about media and people and structuring stories and jokes and trying to come up with ways to surprise comedy is just surprised weve got over that, which is something that maybe a lot of films want to try to do, too, is give you information and entertaining and surprising way. And isn't that what comedians want to dio? And I also wonder, since you know so much what jobs are good critics, what exactly is your job that makes you such a good critic? I mean, I know that you're on Reddit writing a comment. So you must be what? The fuckin a o scott from the fuckin New York times? Are you just some fucking Schumacher who did it? Like what I said about a movie? Because you liked it. Maybe you feel done that you didn't get it, that they screwed up the movie. And by the way, if I don't like the bug in parts of imitation game where it''s a bunch of little kids acting and I did like the other parts of it and I wanted to stop going back to that, that doesn't mean that I don't understand the concept to characterization. It means I didn't enjoy watching that part of the film. And I'm allowed to say that without someone taking the entire profes'sion, which, by the way, I'm not really comedian. I'm actually fucking screenwriter, and that''s what I get paid to do more than I don't do Fuck it. Stand up jokes. Okay. So, yeah, I think I thought a lot about stories and I could put it up on the screen for people to enjoy. So that''s just that''s this aside. No, but what is it that you do again? I can't remember. So anyway, it''s a net pick to you different 40 minutes into the film. I don't like the movie anymore. I don't know that doesn't feel that nit picky to me. There were plenty of plot twist's for you. Let me ask you something. Son of a mama. Was there any point where you didn't think the kid was going to get to the fucking drop zone at the moment that he needed to be there? No. You knew he was gonna get there. Did you not know what was gonna happen after he said, Like, the aliens live in the world, but they're just in a layer that we can't see.
