You think that that the carnival mirror is how clowns looked away? So carnival mirror is a little different as well. Circus mirror and a carnival mirror. Not neces'sarily the same thing, but a funhouse mirror is not either of those. No, no, no. Okay, wait a second. Let me let then if a clown put on makeup in a normal mirror, would he not look clownish, would it just looked like very nice makeup. You're saying if he wasn't using a funhouse or carnival mirror? I honestly think all makeup is for clowns, and I prefer natural natural women. Well, I think I actually think that all mirrors in any house is a fun house mirror. If I'm there, did you read?
