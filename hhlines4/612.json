There's great value with the unlimited download model. Unlimited downloads to the library of 100,000 plus HD video clips after effects templates and motion backgrounds. 250,000 graphics. On average, subscribers pay less than a dollar per download over the course of a year. That's almost nothing. And, ah, in terms of whether you feel like I'm judging you with those examples. Ah, I like that vertical horizon song, too, so I would never judge someone for that. There's premium content, the same content you would find on more expensive stock sites. But we have it here for less great variety of time lapse aerials, US international locations, slow motion nature shots if you know what I mean and more continuously.
