Just choose from a variety of step by step chef designed recipe options, all with insanely delicious flavors. Then get rid of your grocery list and let Blue Apron do the meal prep for you. Whether you're looking for a quick and easy mitt, meals are full culinary cooking experience. Blue Apron has you covered? Um still me. Just me. I am very happy with how this is going. How I'm doing. I do think I'm doing a good job. Um, you will notice doing this ad Normally, Chef Kevin would sort of appear ah, and sort riff off of his takes on the theme menu for this month for her Blue Apron or some of the foods that they're doing this month. Um, and you may be noticing that we don't have any foods mentioned in the ad this week. Blue Apron is, of course, still doing foods. Um, but one reason we're skipping them this week is there was, ah, little mis'step with Kevin''s plan for the foods that that he wanted to do this week. He wanted to dio scary Halloween Blue Apron Ah, and of course, Kevin''s sort of signature food is spaghetti, and he was going to prepare the spaghetti in a way that it was the witches hair. And he, of course, when you're sending the Blue Apron food, they don't said they send ingredients, they don't send him all cooked already. Of course, that''s a fun. You do it yourself, and I love doing it. But the spaghetti was dried, and it came with a recipe of that he Did called Scary Soup. But that was already hot, and there was an is'sue in the delivery proces's where there was a guy driving a truck, and he''s driving the scary soup and the witches hair. The dried spaghetti and some of the scary soup, which was very high, Did spill. And it Did, uh, boil the spaghetti, which caused it to very rapidly increase in size. And the cook spaghetti busted through the wall of the truck into the cab where the driver was, and the driver Did drowned in spaghetti. Although that''s allegedly what happened, it is unclear if he was going to drown already and if it didn't have anything to do with the spaghetti. So that is sort of the legal avenue that Kevin is exploring now, although he is currently in jail. So that''s why there''s no blue. It does. That is, just to explain why there''s no specific Blue Apron foods. You can check out this week''s menu and get your 1st 3 meals free at Blue Apron dot com slash handbook.
