So But anyway, I did me that medicine, and that's fine. Um, but I also wanted you to be here because Scotsman have something that I think youll be pleasantly surprised to learn, Which is Ah, we when you were off doing your past actually took our own look at ah Volleyball: A Real Underdog Story. And I think we cracked it. Do you feel like we cracked it, Scully? Man? Yeah, we cracked it like an egg. We cracked. We cracked it so hard. Band black and way Put that in there. Actually, that's a That's a joke. And I think that crack that, like, an egg is a joke. Ah, fuck, yeah, We say it. Ah, probably once or twice a page in the script just because it is so funny to think about an egg cracking, but we mean cracking it, like figuring it out. So you guys are sending me notes for Volleyball: A Real Underdog Story. And I'm taking the notes and taking my past, but you're taking a separate past together. You guys just hanging out. You know what it was is we just started hanging a little more. Um, uh, we ran into each other at this sort of little ah soir, Eh? That was taking place on Scotsmans bus. I You had a party on the bus. I had a I had a back to the future party of the bus. You remember back to the future day? Uh oh, yeah, because this is 2015 and that's to go up. I remember Cubs. The Cubs beat the Gators, Eh? Eh, MPH? Yeah. Uh, great. Scott, you know not Yeah, that's not as iconic, but that Tony, Eh? So you have a party. You're not inviting me. You're just avoiding me scares me. It feels like it feels like you guys. Well, one thing l and B, it's Guzman kind of feel like back to the future is like our movie. Like we really loved that movie, which I don't think a lot of people have ownership over that, you know, right, like this was like it was like, You're a little secret back to the future. Can the movie just for you and your friends? Yeah. Just means Guzman really got it. And we actually think it's a classic. Contrary to popular opinion, I can't believe you're talking about being cozied up to scuzz man so much like, I mean, you you hated Scotsman. It's a blues. Riff it and be and watch me for the changes and try to keep up Oh, from yeah, because white people really invented rock n roll. Yes. And that And I love that message that Chuck Berry like, probably couldn't have figured it out himself because he just didn't have the sort of faculty to do so. But Nike cousin was able to record a white man playing it, and that is how we got all this great music we Love. There's a lot of conversations that we have about the movie, then Junk. Berry was a dumb idiot, and it's Guzman has brought up this point that maybe sort of the way we celebrate diversity is kind of false. And that probably is man. A lot of the inventions are only coming from one people. You know, You know, I I just want to say, Sean, I'm a little worried about, like, some because I'm just hearing discussed. I'm just hearing this Guzmans opinions coming out of your mouth and even the way you said Hot now, challenging me like a brat like some sort of kind of Bart Simpson type. Oh, I Karam Bowman. No, he just give you an eye. Corumba. How did that feel? It didn't feel good. It didn't feel good. Scuzz man a year too uptight, dumb. I'm not too uptight. All right, You know what? In these intervening months, where I've reached out to this Guzman Teoh tryto help it like for some personal things to for some support with things that are going on with my dad. Oh, yeah? Well, that got a little heavy for this. Guzman, I just said my dad sick in a text. Yeah. And then you blocked me. Yeah, sending any more time. And I don't like to hear words like sick and Dad in the same sentence. And it just creates not cool thoughts in my head, you know? And I don't, uh you know, a man that's a one way to get this guys man off your off your side, you know? Well, that wasnt that wasnt good. Yeah, it kind of seems like you were out of line. Um, I don't know if that's true, Sean. I don't feel that way. I mean, I hear what I'm trying to say is that I've woken up a little bit, too. Who discussed man really is a person. I mean, that's somebody who thought was my friend. He's talking. He's a chill ass, M, Eh? For with a bad tude and ah, cool nude. He's got a great new deported of himself. You have a new portrait of yourself? Yeah, I got a bad attitude and a cool nude hangs on the roof of the bus, and everybody has instead, it hangs on the bad smf roof inside.

I just wish it wasnt so personal. I wish there wasnt. Well, let me get just turn. And so this is just the next thing that happens in the scene. And I think it's kind of a cool moment. So, uh, Shane looks out at the sunset, as he did in the old draft. But this time he inhales deeply smelling the ocean air. It brings him back to his childhood. The sense and the memories smell is the sense most closely related to memory Cents S E N S C, not S C, E and ts, which is what he was saying before when he said the sense of his childhood. He remembers curling up close to the event where the dryer steam would leak out. When his mom was doing the load of laundry and the smell he would inhale so deeply it and how he desired to be closer to it. Somehow it was a smell that was at the same time thrilling and frustrating. How could he have mawr of it? It wasnt like smelling a pie where you get to take a bite or even the perfume of a woman where you get toe, take a bite and it was getting go ahead of me. I just I just stop you because because I just am go ahead looking ahead. And this the scene goes on our another 10 pages. Well, he really likes the smell. Yes, but I I I think it's worth considering that there's that. Maybe on screen, it might just read as ah guy looking out at the beach for 10 minutes and have no idea what he's thinking are I don't know about that. He's time traveling. I mean, it's inspired by our Love for back to the future. Remember, you get your damn dirty hands offer, you know? Yeah, So it's kind of like that. He's time traveling through his nose because the smell makes him remember being a child and curling up. No, I didn't like a team from the dryer was I didn't know they were going to be seeing that. No, you don't see it. You can't see it. We don't have the budget. You just read it discussed, man, You don't even own a computer. What? Right.
