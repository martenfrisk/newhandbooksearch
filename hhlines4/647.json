You just sort of go right up to the water found, maybe drink a lot of water. People say like, Oh, he's just here. Toe, get a drink on. Then you take some gum and use the gum toe stick the water fountain button down. So it z whats pressed down and the water keeps flowing and that way theyll hear the water found and think you're still taking a drink. But while it's running, you go over to the book section of the library and you find the book you like. If the book isnt there, you go to a different library. You start. You know, you do the waterfront thing again there, Um, so you get the book, you flip through the book, you get a sense of some of the characters voices, cause you're gonna be reading this out loud. So just flip through the book enough to know, like, whos a girl and stuff on. Then what you do is you take out your phone and you open a voice memo you hit record on, and that this is the important part is you hold the phone up to your ear like you are having a phone conversation and you read the book into the phone on. If somebody tells, you know, phone to the library, then just go to the bathroom and do it. They're facing a urinal because they're not allowed. Toc stop you from using your phone at a urinal. And if you're a girl that you can still you're you're allowed to use that bathroom as well. It's against the law for them to tell you that you can't, um, some reasons to use audible if you like to go that route instead. Uh, they include, like I said, 180,000 audio programs. Free APS for iPhones, iPad, Android Windows phone. You can listen on pretty much any device you own your books. There's whisper Sync, let You switch. Switch back and forth between reading the book on a Kindle or kindle app and listening to the audiobook. Um, so that has its advantages to I'm not going to say how you should do it. Ah, book I recommend is Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari. Somebody ripped ah, bunch of the pages out of the library One. So youll have to make up what goes. And it's kind of peaches and a 39 toc 69.
