I don't want to get spoiled on that. So I won't look at that. What? Your favorite horror movie? No. Sorry. Ah ah. Uh, that's more star Worst. His rise, all the standards. Ah. Oh, James Bond. Now, uh, this is something that I'm sure that I have an opinion on the director offers tips to young directors. Okay. Ah. Whered you get that idea? Sam? Mendez offering tips. Uh oh. Let me guess. I do it and hes kind of helps when I do this show. It's so think about this, everybody. Sam Mendez comes in and tells you how to direct, and you are listening to him instead of listening to me. Me, Ah, and and imagine that how your movies would be instead of good. Like what I said to do here is probably what he says how to direct and I'll see what his tips are. And I'll tell you if they're good or not, and he's got 10 of them. Get in touch with your inner 12 year old. Ah, no, Get in touch with your inner, like 16 year old because when you're 12 you don't really know how to have sex. Good yet, And I know hes wouldn't want to talk about that. But honestly, like, yeah, you're starting to do it, of course. And we all were. But you're actually not great at it yet because a lot of it you're still just so surprised of like what All the pieces is, you know, So don't do that. All right. You can only ever point the camera one thing at a time. Uh, okay, Number one, get two cameras. Number two heard of a GoPro. You can actually see the whole ocean with it. So and just strap it to something. So number three, you're praying roulette with someone else. Money. If you're gonna bet it all on black, you need to be able to explain why. So this is about diversity and film, Obviously, Um, I know it's a problem. You know, it's a problem. Violet Davis knows a problem she talked about in speech. So I would say that I don't understand why Sam Mendez is saying everyone like, if you put black people in your movie, you have to have a really good reason for me. The good reason would just be they should be in movies, too. And I know that's not popular to say, And I know certainly Hayes wouldn't want them in their um but I think those guys air great and even Chinese guys and ah, Spanish guys to could all do in the movies. And they should all get paid the same as how much money they make back. So that to me and also about, like, wage inequality in general. The reason that some kinds of people are getting paid less than other kinds of people is that certain kinds of people probably don't do all their own stunts like Tom Cruise does now and and take that. Hes you wouldn't you would have tried to stop me from saying that. Number four making action sequences only interesting When you're in the cutting room up until then, it is literally the most tedious thing you will ever dio. So that's his tip to you as a director. So I guess he's saying, Don't make action sequences is But I actually think there are a lot of times are the best part of movies, especially if it's an action based movie like James Bond. The guy who made James Bond is saying, Don't do any action sequences. I'm sorry. I call B s. Oh, wait, I can actually say it now. Bull spit.

And and so he's saying, Look, you're the boss, you're the director. If you are feeling sort of saucy and you got the juices flowing downstairs, don't be afraid to let people know. Hey, this is what I'm working with. And ah, right now, Since you all work for me, you should have to look at it and singing the bond theme. I assume that's a joke. It's probably You can sing anything you want. Um, and that's something we're gonna be doing on this show. Now is I can play more of the kind of music that I like. Hayes does it really always, like, have you know, the best taste in music?
