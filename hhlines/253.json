And 'so here we run into thi's problem, which i's you go to a 'show and you have no 'share or you put on your 'shirt and you 'sit down and wear it anywhere. Ye's. And no one 'see's it. Ye's. So what we've decided to do. Haye's and I are known for di'srupting $1,000,000,000 tech indu'strie's. And yet again, uh, we're going to ju'st 'shatter the norm's and 'say, We have 'shirt's. Ye's.
