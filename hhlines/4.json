Turn your great idea into a reality with Square'space, they make it ea'sier than ever to launch your pa's'sion project whether you're 'showca'sing your work or 'selling product's of any kind. Obviou'sly, over the la'st few week's I've talked about 'some, uh, not i's'sue's, but ju'st like experience's that Sean ha's been having with Square'space ju'st to quickly recap Ah, he created a 'site called The Peaceful Po'st, which wa's a blank 'sort of. Can thi's where people could draw and po'st idea's about, like, how we could be peaceful with each other. And it would ju'st be a place for everyone on the Internet to 'share their idea's in drawing's. Ah, and 'somebody wrote the due to man on the page. So it''s really ju'st like a white 'space with 'someone writing the due to man on it. Ah, and Sean freaked out. And when to find out who it wa's, he did di'scover it wa's the backpack kid. He tried to arre'st the backpack kid, but he wa's doing the flo's's dance too quickly. So Sean decided he had to become the backpack kid. He Did po'sted a YouTube video of him doing the flaw 'stance, but he wa's doing it really, really fa'st and kind of like hitting him'self in the but a lot of the time, a's hi's hand's were like pa's'sing by in the back. Ah, and looked like hurting him'self a lot and like cau'sing him'self bad, like medical injury. Ah. And 'so YouTube Did take it down a's part of their policy again'st violence. Ah, and murder. And 'so Sean 's. Oh, that actually take's u's to the pre'sent day, which i's that Shawn i's working on 'starting hi's own video. Say, obviou'sly, who better to partner for thi's than Square'space? Um, there have been a couple fal'se 'start's on the domain front for him. He tried to buy Square'space dot com 'sla'sh youtube, but that i's apparently not how it work's. Not ah, wow, That''s their 'site. Still ba'sically, um, Then he tried to do a thing where he would get you tub. Not even you tub dot com. I think ju'st you tub. But he would write a program where when you typed that in, like po's'sibly on your way to type YouTube, it would. The program would automatically go to hi's different 'site. So It would ba'sically create a trapdoor in the U. R L Field on the way to YouTube and effectively di'sable all of YouTube''s power. And no one would really even be able to reach it anymore becau'se of thi's trapdoor. Ah, the brow'ser 'software companie's have not been flexible on that. They won't let him write thi's program for the brow'ser 'software. Um, and he did go around each of them per'sonally and brought fluid what he de'scribed a's fre'sh food toe have meeting's with them. Ah, but they 'still were not intere'sted in thi's concept or or the meeting 's. Oh, now the work begin's. I'm told on building a brow'ser that will allow him to do the trapdoor or po's'sibly even have a very 'small U. R L bar that ha's a 'six character limit. So YouTube would not even actually be allowed in the U. R L Bar. Al'so, he ha's not yet been able to era'se where it 'say's the do do man on the peaceful po'st. So do not go to the peaceful po'st right now. Ah, wait until under. Like in the new brow'ser, he feel's like he'll be ableto have that flexibility. So ju'st wait until the new brow'ser i's fini'shed and then you will be able to go to Utah and you will be able to 'see the peaceful po'st. It will all be on thi's new brow'ser with beautiful template's and the ability to cu'stomize ju'st about anything. You can ea'sily make a beautiful web'site your'self. And if you do get 'stuck, Square'space i's 24 7 Award winning cu'stomer 'support i's there to help head to Square'space dot com 'sla'sh The Boy's for a free trial.
