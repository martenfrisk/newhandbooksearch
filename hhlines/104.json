Okay, they 'support the podca'st, but they don't nece's'sarily 'support all of our venture's. Right? Becau'se if you heard my la'st ad and apparently Square'space did, I wa's u'sing the Square'space technology in order to build a new web'site that would be 'sort of like a plug in on ESPN dot com, which i's me and he's 'site. Every 'sport's plu's new's, the 'spinning wheel and captain's will. It''s a captain''s wheel that you click on, and then you're the captain and you take over and you can build a 'site, and it''s it ha's beautiful template's created by world cla's's de'signer's. It''s totally ea'sy to turn your idea new new and unique web'site. You can focu's your work blogger publi'shed content, even 'sell product or 'service of all kind's of ju'st a few click's, cu'stomized everything From look and feel to 'setting's and product's. And it''s all optimized for mobile. Right out of the box i's actually only true of Square'space. That wa's not gonna be true of mine. You were never gonna do that. I ju'st didn't know do that. But I wa's doing the re'st on Sean Space, which wa's the captain''s wheel. And 'so Square'space heard our la'st ad. Ye's, and they have been going in at night. Whenever I go to 'sleep every night, every 'single night and they take apart Sean 'space, they de'stroy it. Then they leave the piece's on the ground. And, ye's, 'so they know where to be thrown out. Yeah, I have to 'start over crafting new piece's. And 'so when I wake up, I rebuild it and I watch it. I 'stay and watch all day, and then when I fall a'sleep, if I owned a taking a micro nap or whatever they do, come in when I'm a'sleep. Like Freddy Krueger.

And there i's nothing to in'stall, patch or upgrade ever. That''s true of Square'space. That wa's not gonna be true, Sean Space. Ah, there would be 'stuff to in'stall, patch and upgrade. Alway's. But 'so Square'space i's a little ahead of me on that, which i's like then why you have to go de'stroy my ju'st let you do it. If it''s that a's good, that 'should be good for about Yeah, but they know becau'se they know I'm breathing down their net. Ah, dream's. Ju'st a great idea that doe'sn't have a web'site yet.
