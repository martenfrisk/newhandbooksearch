And I think we cracked it. Do you feel like we cracked it, Scully? Man? Yeah, we cracked it like an egg. We cracked. We cracked it so hard. Band black and way Put that in there. Actually, that's a That's a joke. And I think that crack that, like, an egg is a joke. Ah, fuck, yeah, We say it. Ah, probably once or twice a page in the script just because it is so funny to think about an egg cracking, but we mean cracking it, like figuring it out. So you guys are sending me notes for Volleyball: A Real Underdog Story. And I'm taking the notes and taking my past, but you're taking a separate past together. You guys just hanging out. You know what it was is we just started hanging a little more. Um, uh, we ran into each other at this sort of little ah soir, Eh? That was taking place on Scotsman's bus. I You had a party on the bus. I had a I had a back to the future party of the bus. You remember back to the future day? Uh oh, yeah, because this is 2015 and that's to go up. I remember Cubs.

You're just avoiding me scares me. It feels like it feels like you guys. Well, one thing l and B, it's Guzman kind of feel like back to the future is like our movie. Like we really loved that movie, which I don't think a lot of people have ownership over that, you know, right, like this was like it was like, You're a little secret back to the future. Can the movie just for you and your friends? Yeah. Just means Guzman really got it. And we actually think it's a classic.

Riff it and be and watch me for the changes and try to keep up Oh, from yeah, because white people really invented rock n roll. Yes. And that And I love that message that Chuck Berry like, probably couldn't have figured it out himself because he just didn't have the sort of faculty to do so. But Nike cousin was able to record a white man playing it, and that is how we got all this great music we Love. There's a lot of conversations that we have about the movie, then Junk. Berry was a dumb idiot, and it's Guzman has brought up this point that maybe sort of the way we celebrate diversity is kind of false. And that probably is man. A lot of the inventions are only coming from one people. You know, You know, I I just want to say, Sean, I'm a little worried about, like, some because I'm just hearing discussed. I'm just hearing this Guzman's opinions coming out of your mouth and even the way you said Hot now, challenging me like a brat like some sort of kind of Bart Simpson type. Oh, I Karam Bowman. No, he just give you an eye. Corumba. How did that feel? It didn't feel good. It didn't feel good. Scuzz man a year too uptight, dumb. I'm not too uptight. All right, You know what? In these intervening months, where I've reached out to this Guzman Teoh tryto help it like for some personal things to for some support with things that are going on with my dad. Oh, yeah? Well, that got a little heavy for this. Guzman, I just said my dad sick in a text. Yeah. And then you blocked me. Yeah, sending any more time. And I don't like to hear words like sick and Dad in the same sentence. And it just creates not cool thoughts in my head, you know? And I don't, uh you know, a man that's a one way to get this guy's man off your off your side, you know? Well, that wasn't that wasn't good. Yeah, it kind of seems like you were out of line. Um, I don't know if that's true, Sean. I don't feel that way. I mean, I hear what I'm trying to say is that I've woken up a little bit, too. Who discussed man really is a person.

Yes, but I I I think it's worth considering that there's that. Maybe on screen, it might just read as ah guy looking out at the beach for 10 minutes and have no idea what he's thinking are I don't know about that. He's time traveling. I mean, it's inspired by our Love for back to the future. Remember, you get your damn dirty hands offer, you know? Yeah, So it's kind of like that. He's time traveling through his nose because the smell makes him remember being a child and curling up. No, I didn't like a team from the dryer was I didn't know they were going to be seeing that.
