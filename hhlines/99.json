So, uh, one fight that we had wa's when we were in Chicago, we were on our way running a little bit late, actually, to get to the theater for 'sound check to do or 'show at that onion fe'stival, and we were walking. And we're walking by thi's coffee place that had a 'specific kind of coffee that I like and we had already called Ah, car 'service. Teoh, come pick u's up one of the big AP's And he's had done it on hi's phone and I 'said, uh, 'sorry. Do I have time to ju'st 'stop in for coffee real quick? And he in a tone that I did not like, went No, you don't. And I wa's like, Hey, f you, you know, becau'se I ju'st didn't like he 'sort of 'scoffed. And then, um, I got in the car with him and we went all the way to the theater. And then I walked out to get a coffee right next to the theater, and I really didn't like it wa'sn't very good. And I knew that I could have had that other one. We were about to do the'se two 'show's in front of a big group of people that I wa's pretty nervou's about. And little thing's like having the coffee I want make me feel more comfortable before 'something like that. And 'so I wa's mad at him and being 'snippy and I wa's on, like, Day eight of, like, a 10 day cour'se of predni'sone, which, um, wa's to treat acute fair in J tou's al'so 'something that, you know, I wa's like, I have to talk to all the'se people in my throat i's me's'sed up, but it wa's making me not 'sleep well. I wa's irritable and and 'sweaty, and, um, anyway, that''s a really good fight that we had where I wa's like, if you don't 'say that to me that we don't have enough time and he 'said, Well, I call the car The car wa's gonna leave in two minute's. We were running late to the feet already, and I 'said, But I didn't get the coffee I wanted and he 'said he didn't realize that wa's 'so important to me. Anyway. It''s all fine now, and that''s a good fight. But there''s even better one's on the 'show. The Good Fight on CBS All Acce's's Chri'stine Baran'ski i's back a's the venerable Diane Lockhart, along with Cu'sh, Jumbo Ro'se, Le'slie, Sarah Steele and Audra McDonald.
