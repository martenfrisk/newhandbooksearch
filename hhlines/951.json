Ah, I ju'st Ah, I am actually adding new element's to the pillow. I thought it could be really intere'sting to have thi's mou'se of a mou'se on it. That''s 'sleeping. And to have 'so 'so the mou'se i's dreaming of a piece of chee'se. Ah, and then I wa's a come. What would the chee'se dream about? And 'so the chee'se, you know, there''s like a little dreaming bubble from the chee'se, and the chee'se i's dreaming about 'some cut up apple's. That would be that it want's to be, like combined with ah, and then the cut up apple's are dreaming about Steve Job's becau'se of Apple computer. Ah, Steve Job's i's dreaming about computer, and 'so, like it ju'st it kind of continue's in thi's chain all the way around the pillow. Everyone, everything i's dreaming about 'something el'se, which i's true. Ah, and then it loop's back around like I accidentally ran out of 'space. And 'so I have a ba'seball bat that i's dreaming about the mou'se becau'se that''s ju'st like when it looped around. There wa'sn't enough room to put another thing in between. So I decided, I gue's's, figure out a 'story for why that would be happening. Uh, guy's, the ea'sie'st way to ea'se back into a po'st 'summer routine 'simplified the morning and evening's with an electric toothbru'sh from Quip time's. Sonic vibration's offering effective clean. That''s gentle on your 'sen'sitive gum's in ju'st two minute's, twice a day. So I gue's's thi's i's that''s, like, one way to do it, for 'sure. Uh, for me, thi's i's the time of year, end of September, like after I have gone back to 'school for a couple week's. Thi's i's when I will do all my tooth bru'shing for the entire year. I I will ju'st carve out a week. I will not go to 'school. Ah, and ju'st get it all done. So two minute's a day, twice a day. Ah, that''s Ah, four minute's a day, time's three and 65. So I will ba'sically ju'st bru'sh my teeth for over 1000 minute's. Ah, and that 'save's me. I feel like from having to, like, go like, Oh, I'm doing 'something el'se. Oh, no, I got to go bru'sh my teeth. It''s like actually making the time for thi's very important thing. Ah, but ju'st like doing it all at once. And I alway's rent a place I would like go up the coa'st and I want to place and I bru'sh my teeth for over 1000 minute's. Ah, and the moat to u'se cover work's a's a 'stand and mount's to Mier's putting bru'shing front and center in your bathroom. So obviou'sly, if you do it the way I do it, you do not need to be reminded throughout the year with the 'stand or whatever, You can ba'sically put it away until next year. Better yet, the lightweight compact de'sign mean's you can bring it along with you on tho'se la'st 'summer weekend getaway's, 'so that i's u'seful to May and bru'sh head's are automatically delivered on a denti'st recommended 'schedule every three month's for ju'st $5 making it ea'sy to 'stay committed to your oral health. I don't need them. I love Quip. I love the toothpa'ste. I I love that. It tell's me when I'm done bru'shing good product's, and that''s why I love Quip and why it''s perfect for getting back into a routine Quip 'start's in ju'st $25.
