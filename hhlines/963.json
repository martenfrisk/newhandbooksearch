Um, and you may be noticing that we don't have any food's mentioned in the ad thi's week. Blue Apron i's, of cour'se, 'still doing food's. Um, but one rea'son we're 'skipping them thi's week i's there wa's, ah, little mi's'step with Kevin''s plan for the food's that that he wanted to do thi's week. He wanted to dio 'scary Halloween Blue Apron Ah, and of cour'se, Kevin''s 'sort of 'signature food i's 'spaghetti, and he wa's going to prepare the 'spaghetti in a way that it wa's the witche's hair. And he, of cour'se, when you're 'sending the Blue Apron food, they don't 'said they 'send ingredient's, they don't 'send him all cooked already. Of cour'se, that''s a fun. You do it your'self, and I love doing it. But the 'spaghetti wa's dried, and it came with a recipe of that he Did called Scary Soup. But that wa's already hot, and there wa's an i's'sue in the delivery proce's's where there wa's a guy driving a truck, and he''s driving the 'scary 'soup and the witche's hair. The dried 'spaghetti and 'some of the 'scary 'soup, which wa's very high, Did 'spill. And it Did, uh, boil the 'spaghetti, which cau'sed it to very rapidly increa'se in 'size. And the cook 'spaghetti bu'sted through the wall of the truck into the cab where the driver wa's, and the driver Did drowned in 'spaghetti. Although that''s allegedly what happened, it i's unclear if he wa's going to drown already and if it didn't have anything to do with the 'spaghetti. So that i's 'sort of the legal avenue that Kevin i's exploring now, although he i's currently in jail. So that''s why there''s no blue. It doe's.
