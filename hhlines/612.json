Video Blocks is an affordable subscription based stock media site that gives you unlimited access to premium stock footage. Whether you're making a montage of cartoon characters getting decapitated set to that one vertical horizon song you like or just indulging your foot fetish. The benefits are numerous. There's great value with the unlimited download model. Unlimited downloads to the library of 100,000 plus HD video clips after effects templates and motion backgrounds. 250,000 graphics. On average, subscribers pay less than a dollar per download over the course of a year. That's almost nothing. And, ah, in terms of whether you feel like I'm judging you with those examples. Ah, I like that vertical horizon song, too, so I would never judge someone for that. There's premium content, the same content you would find on more expensive stock sites. But we have it here for less great variety of time lapse aerials, US international locations, slow motion nature shots if you know what I mean and more continuously. Adding new content to the library so it stays fresh is a real priority for video blocks. And don't forget their simple unrestricted licensing. Everything's 100% royalty free now. I told them they should make it 90% royalty free. I said at least take a 10% royalty and video blocks punched me in the face on restricted usage rights or for personal or commercial projects. and you get to keep what you download and maintain usage rights forever or until you die.
