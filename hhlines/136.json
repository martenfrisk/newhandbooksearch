Ah, One thing we do remember i's that it wa's very, very ten'se trying to get to the front of the line for, like a checkpoint and that they did that about three time's in the la'st half hour of the movie. Um, and we have the part of our mi's'sion coming up where we have to do checkpoint's, and we're very 'stre's'sed about it becau'se I don't know how we're gonna get through three of them. I don't remember how they got through it. I ju'st remember there wa's 'sort of like, a ticking clock like, Oh, no. What about the thing when we get to the checkpoint? Yeah, that happened and then immediately happened again and then immediately happened again in that movie. And we're afraid that that might happen, tow u's and then happened to u's again and then happened again. And 'so we're feeling very 'scared. Um, we have tried to get in touch with 'some of the people who did that movie, Uh, but really all of them while we've gotten back, i's they are 'still 'saying, Argo, fuck your'self. That''s very funny to them. You have i's funny to me too. And I have been laughing, but I've al'so been trying to tell them Hey, we really need help. We're trying to do thi's 'super Argo mi's'sion in thi's country where they have a lot of 'sand that can 'say name a country. But it''s one of the mean one's, and they were trying to do 'something 'special and be heroe's. And you guy's are making it hard, becau'se when we a'sk you a que'stion, you ju'st go, Argo, fuck your'self and we crack up ju'st a's we did when we watched that 'screener two year's ago, maybe three year's ago. Um And, uh 'so that i's fun. And we could all u'se 'some levity, but it al'so i's not great ju'st becau'se what we're dealing with i's we might get 'stopped at a checkpoint, maybe die. And my only hope i's that there''s one guy who 'seem's really difficulty and, like not on board with the plan and that he'll 'step up and be a hero. Like what I think happened at the end of the argo. The original, Not the original Argo, the Argo, where they were the rial Argo where they were pretending to make a movie called Argo. That wa's a fake movie that, I gue's's at one point, wa's a real movie. And it wa's ba'sed on a true 'story. So now we're doing a fake ver'sion of that real movie where they were pretend to make a real movie in a fake way. So anyway, that''s all the new's from the Super Argo front.
