It's one of those ones with, like, three wheels that looks kind of stupid and cool at the same time.

That I mean, it does convey it, but that's just because you're acting like that's a lot of lesser actors. But how would you know? What's that? How would you know that? Unless you read it. Wait, Isn't that making my point for May? No, no, no, not at all. Okay. You still get the ultra realism. You have to read it. I mean, you can't just watch it. What's Guzman has really taught me about film is that many times it doesn't reflect our real life. And where I had had notes on the 10 page nap in your original draft, we've now extended it to be closer to 42 pages. And yes, that is how long a nap would take. I was seeing that I was kind of flipping ahead to some of the other. I mean, one thing I will say about this scene then we just read is I don't think that the viewing on like it kind of directly references of previous draft script. You don't know that's good. I just don't think people will understand. I think people will need. But it sounds like there's a plan in place to have people reading along with the script as they're watching this movie is that would help, yes, and they very much help. Ideally, they've read the old draft before they start watching it, too. And then they're reading the current draft while they watch it. You're not allowed into the movie unless you've read. It's a whole dress, fully interactive experience. And that, I think, is the future of film this. You never said film this way before. That's a Scotsman thing, to call it a feel. Well, you know, I've created my own term. I've created a lot of my own terms, and film is one of You know what? I used to love hearing these. You talk for hours about the difference between film and film and what it meant, but I can't stomach it anymore. And where I orbed it did. We'll be filming it on film. We're not shooting this digital because we can tell the difference. And we need the grain. Digital looks about as good as it. I mean, it's just a production thing. It's ask you what? Oh, sorry, but come on. You know, that's bs. Now, uh, I just remembered because, man, I, um, have the cash that you wanted. Oh, wait, What's this for? He really He really needs its just because? No, because he just got jumped by some of the beach cops. And so he had had a bunch of cash that he was He was bringing you got jumped by beach. Told me that same story, Shawn. And he and he borrowed $500 I never saw it. And I in the back of my mind. I knew what he does. He only gave you 500. Well, now we know who the true friend is. How much money? How much money is in that envelope? $225,000. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, those beach guys, he's gonna have much money if he's gonna get me back. He's good for it because he's actually gonna He knows where the beach cops keep their stash. Just think about this story that he's telling you. He's telling you that a bunch of beach cups, a bunch of officers of the law jumped him and took over 200 grand that he was carrying on his person. Yeah, well, it was, for he was gonna pay rent on his bus location. No, but think about that like that. There's no way that that's that much money. I mean, what? How much? First of all, he's parks on the street. There's no rent rest and what's head in the sand are you rolled the bus in the sand. Now you put the bus on the symbol notices and or in the street. So the beach cops are probably responding to that. No, man, they're just So you're saying you do believe the beach cop story? I'm saying that maybe he got in trouble with beach cups, but they didn't still hundreds of thousands of dollars from him. Just think about it. I just don't want to see him. You into the same me.
