So ba'sically, you either do love HH or you don't really care about Shawn''s take on film. And maybe you don't care about my take on film becau'se you ju'st wanted to put out your take on film and have your little moment where you get to feel like Sean Hollywood. Hamburg could get to tell everybody what he think's about the different thing's ea'sy, and you're gonna now be thi's 'smart guy. It actually know what''s really going on in Midnight 'special, and that you actually have to admit in your review that everyone agree's the film lo'se's your word's a little when it give's away 'some of the early my'stici'sm. Well, the whole fucking fir'st half of the movie i's ju'st handed on you being curiou's about the early Mr's um and the color and all that, and it e's'sentially i's ju'st the audience, 'sort of putting together the puzzle piece's of trying to figure out exactly what''s going on. And my experience wa's a's 'soon a's I had gotten the edge's of the puzzle in place. I found out that the entire center of the puzzle wa's ju'st one big piece that got dropped in in a moment. But I 'still had to 'sit there and look at the fini'sh puzzle for another hour and 20 minute's. So my experience at the film wa's not that enjoyable, but you liked it. So I gue's's you are the per'son who doe's have a take on film we all need to Hear. And, ah, i's it true? I gue's's that comedian's don't make good critic's. I's that a good characterization to make that entire profe's'sion would make good critic's? Ah, profe's'sion, who ba'sically on Lee think's about media and people and 'structuring 'storie's and joke's and trying to come up with way's to 'surpri'se comedy i's ju'st 'surpri'sed we've got over that, which i's 'something that maybe a lot of film's want to try to do, too, i's give you information and entertaining and 'surpri'sing way. And i'sn't that what comedian's want to dio? And I al'so wonder, 'since you know 'so much what job's are good critic's, what exactly i's your job that make's you 'such a good critic? I mean, I know that you're on Reddit writing a comment. So you mu'st be what? The fuckin a o 'scott from the fuckin New York time's? Are you ju'st 'some fucking Schumacher who did it? Like what I 'said about a movie? Becau'se you liked it. Maybe you feel done that you didn't get it, that they 'screwed up the movie. And by the way, if I don't like the bug in part's of imitation game where it''s a bunch of little kid's acting and I did like the other part's of it and I wanted to 'stop going back to that, that doe'sn't mean that I don't under'stand the concept to characterization. It mean's I didn't enjoy watching that part of the film. And I'm allowed to 'say that without 'someone taking the entire profe's'sion, which, by the way, I'm not really comedian. I'm actually fucking 'screenwriter, and that''s what I get paid to do more than I don't do Fuck it. Stand up joke's. Okay. So, yeah, I think I thought a lot about 'storie's and I could put it up on the 'screen for people to enjoy. So that''s ju'st that''s thi's a'side. No, but what i's it that you do again? I can't remember. So anyway, it''s a net pick to you different 40 minute's into the film. I don't like the movie anymore. I don't know that doe'sn't feel that nit picky to me. There were plenty of plot twi'st's for you. Let me a'sk you 'something. Son of a mama.
