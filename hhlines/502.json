Yeah, actually, they did. But the product I am about to tell you about i's actually located on my phone, and I u'se it 'so much, it''s got me addicted to my phone 'so that I can't put it down. So yeah, I'm recording thi's one from my phone 'so that I can click out of the ad, which I don't even really want to do becau'se I'd rather be u'sing the app. I can go 'straight back to the app and the app i's called Fit bod fit bod. Sean, that 'sound's like you. Yeah, I know. If you've gone to the gym without a plan. You know how overwhelming the weight room can feel. I certainly have been lo'st, confu'sed and often will 'spend two or three hour's in the gym and leave without having done a 'single workout, becau'se I ju'st kind of went and looked at the machine's and couldn't make head's or tail's of the picture's they had on them. Fit Body i's a 'smart fitne's's app that take's the gue's'swork out of planning your workout's, their algorithm factor's in your goal's, experience level equipment, workout duration and mu'scle recovery to craft the perfect total body workout program ju'st for you. Now thi's i's true. I actually have u'sed the APP, and if you do not want a total body workout program, if what you want i's to focu's on a 'single mu'scle, 'specifically, the mu'scle that connect's from it''s like next to like the bottom of the 'six pack, and it goe's in 'sort of point's down toward's like day. We've talked about thi's mu'scle before. Um, anyway, you can 'select that it''s they have little photo's of mu'scle group's, and you can point on that one and 'say, Give me thi's with each workout. The Apple earned your abilitie's and plan's workout's de'signed to maximize your re'sult's. It''s perfect for anyone who''s looking to get better fitne's's re'sult's with your goal. The general fitne's's, 'strength training, mu'scle tone, bodybuilding, powerlifting or, in my ca'se, Olympic weightlifting. If you have equipment, great. If you don't know equipment, they've got body weight routine's. Thi's i's 'something I want to 'say about the app, 'something I do like about it. I have pretty limited equipment. What I have i's to paint can's. Well, really three, but one I want. I don't want to touch cau'se it''s got other 'stuff on it. But I have to paint can's and I do have a um it''s like a bike tire, but it ha's wing's if that make's 'sen'se and tho'se I haven't 'seen them featured on the Apple. Any picture's? But 'sometime's I will pretend that the pain can i's like a dumb bell and that the tire with wing's a's like a re'si'stance band of 'some kind and when they do 'sugge'st, uh, work out to me that I can't do with my current material's.
