Yeah, No, it''s the olde'st 'story. It''s It''s literally the greate'st 'story ever told all thi's tale. It''s alleged that we all know the model's of the Ca'sper-Mattre's'se's The Wave, The e's'sential ah, and the original Ca'sper are ba'sically The three archetype's that you 'see over and over again in 'storytelling. Jo'seph Gamble talked about the's Mattre's'se's, But one thing that we didn't nece's'sarily di'scu's's before becau'se we're 'so focu'sed on the Amazing Night''s 'sleep you can get, i's that the'se are really good Mattre's'se's, Teoh. A good firm ma's'sage on. And ju'st for people to really dig in and hit all the point's 'so you can 'sleep on it at night on your back. But what about during the day when the 'sun come's up, you're looking at thi's thing you like. What i's thi's like? I ju'st throw it away. No, you keep it. And they have technology. Now, uh, that you can now cut a hole in the mattre's's for your face and 'stick your face through and 'still be able to breathe and 'see the 'shoe's of the per'son who''s 'standing above you and i's really digging in and getting all the point's and giving a firm Ma's'son 's. So in'stead of getting up and throwing it away, you can 'stay on it all day. Getting a ma's'sage, whether it''s your 'scaling, i's your Rahm Boyd''s your cue allergy, Aurelio.

They're activating that mu'scle and take what 'someone could do on a Ca'sper mattre's's i's ju'st go all the way down and get on the in'side and touch it. So you do want to cut a new hole every time you do thi's, cau'se your face wa's all rubbed up in the original hole. Obviou'sly, your face i's gro's's and you have to radio up the whole. So yeah, when you get up, you're gonna find that your face ha's produced a lot of 'stuff that ha's filled the whole Haye's and I came into thi's. Ye's, it''s great, becau'se then when you go to 'sleep again, there''s not a hole in your mattre's's.
