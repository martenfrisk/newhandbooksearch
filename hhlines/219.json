Comedy Central doe'sn't really allow it to be out in the world, and there''s alway's been many rumor's about the back'stage 'stuff, and we kind of went all in for the fir'st time and 'spoke publicly about a lot of my demon's addiction's. And did I come up at all? Um, not on the 'show, but I mean, I don't want to fan any flame's. But a's 'soon a's we were done taping, he's did 'stand up and he took hi's headphone's off and he threw them down and he wa's like, Sean could never do that. Shawn could never do that. He throw's him down like a touchdown 'spike, like he''s happy with what he did or like ju'st a mad throw.

There wa's a violence and an emotion to, and I ju'st tried to 'say that I brought you a before and a'sked where you were actually known you much longer. Well, I wa's going to 'say, I'sn't it 'strange to do an epi'sode of haze when meanwhile, we've known each other longer? Probably better. Oh, you and there wa's a 'stretch of life where you and I were very, very, very clo'se. Yeah, and did he Wa's he able to deal with that? Uh, I brought it. I 'said I a'sked where you were. I 'said that You and I Really, I mean, thi's i's not in any way exaggerated. You and I, for many year's were very, very tight on, and I a'sked. I 'said I wa's really looking forward to the chance to catch up with Sean. I feel like we lo'st touch a little bit. I've alway's regretted that. And, uh, he 'said, Really, thi's wa's before the mike's run. And then he 'said you had 'something el'se to dio. I a'sked what, and he 'said, I'd rather not tell you.

Yeah, he''s Now wrong. Anyway, did you guy's talk about politic's at all or anything? No, mo'stly It wa's about about the 'show. Yeah, I told him a lot becau'se, you know, he had 'seen a lot and he had been there for a lot. And many, many rumor's about my behavior and Big Lake. So I told him about 'some of the addiction's. I fell into a lot of the 'sex for money. Different, you know, thing's I wa's inhaling, injecting back in tho'se day's, a lot of demon's. I told him a lot about how my character overtook my per'sonality.
