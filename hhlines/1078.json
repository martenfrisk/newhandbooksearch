Ju'st to hear what they have to talk about. Sure. I want to go to an art exhibit with them and get their thought's on. They are 'something of an art exhibit in their own, right? Well, with a 'sock on their deal, 'so trippy 'some of their old 'stuff i's freaking my being in a major way. I 'saw one of the two wor'st fight's I've ever 'seen in my life at a red Hot Chili Pepper's concert. Ju'st 'saw a guy get the 'shit beat out of him by, like, 'six other guy. Wow. Well, tough to 'say. I wa's 'sitting on the hood of 'someone''s car in the parking lot and I 'saw a guy walking with hi's girlfriend and about five guy's behind and walking with beer bottle's, throwing the bottle cap's at him, and he wa's turning around, going like, Yeah, fuck you, man. Fuck you like? Yeah, I'll fight you 'sometime. But when it''s me and you not when it''s me and you and all your Boy's and the guy wa's going like All right, all right. And thi's girl wa's going Stop, 'stop! Ju'st 'stop. And he wa's like, All right, Book you guy's, But you guy's and then one guy, 'so there, about two row's away 'start's running at, like a pretty 'solid 'speed picking up 'speed a's he goe's through two row's of car's and then around pa'st me goe's right pa'st me. Doe's thi's huge arc word that he then run's around in front of him from the other 'side a's The do. They're like talking to him behind him. He get's like a football field's worth of a full 'sprint going It ju'st land's thi's flying punch on the guy knock's him down, and then the other four guy's have kind of a's they're having thi's argument cornered Off and they clo'se in from all 'side's and ju'st 'start kicking the fucking 'shit out of thi's guy. And then it happen's for 20 'second's, and then they all back off and he get's up and you could ju'st 'see he ha's no idea where he i's. And he''s kind of trying to walk away and they, like, let him get, like, two 'step's and then they ju'st fucking clo'sing and do it again. And hi's girlfriend ju'st 'screaming. I'm 'sitting on the car. I've left the concert literally becau'se I am 'so 'sick from all the drug's and alcohol in my 'sy'stem. And 'so I'm ju'st like on my buddy''s car, waiting for them to come out of the concert concert's. Not over. Uh, and I'm like, alone there, and I'm being like, wow, I mean, I'm not. I cannot be involved in thi's like I 'should. Ah, hero would help. That''s not what I am. So I watch. And then what wa's amazing i's that almo'st immediately, an ambulance pulled up and they put the guy in the back of it, and the girlfriend, like, got in with him and drove away and the other guy's had di'sappeared. But I wa's like, What wa's the 'sy'stem where they were informed? I didn't do it? I mean, I 'should have. She didn't do it like, how did they know? I wa's trying to think of the funnie'st 'song to have been playing in the 'show while thi's wa's going on. I 'shoveled the few option's, like 'scar ti's'sue i's a bit like an obviou's one.
